ch8-la#6: New Level

The plasma charge hit Corporat in the chest. He flew back, crashed into the throne, the mask cracked.

— Impossible...

His body disintegrated into pixels. Only the mask and briefcase remained.

Pozzi picked up the mask. Underneath was a normal human face, about thirty. A document fell from the briefcase:

"Name: Alex. Keeper of Level 100. Status: FIRED".

The platform lit up:

LEVEL 100 COMPLETE
NEXT STOP: LEVEL 200
REWARD: NOTEBOOK RETURNED

Pozzi felt weight in his pocket. Took out the notebook. Opened it — on the first page:

0 / 2000

— Two thousand?

Luna appeared nearby.

— You need to get 2000 kills. Otherwise the system will reject you.

— Why 2000?

— Vertigo 2.0 is a new version. Old rules don't work.

— Where am I?

— At level 100. But this is a dimension. Next is 200. Then 300. Up to 2000.

— And what's there?

— The answer. Why you're here.

She waved her hand. Pozzi was back on the stairs. Sign: "LEVEL 100 → 200".

— Go. Your journey is just beginning.

In the notebook: +1 (Corporat) = 1.

Pozzi put away the notebook and began his ascent. 1900 levels ahead.

(To be continued...)
