ch5-arg#4: Race with Death

Skeletons opened fire, and the first bullets embedded themselves in the house walls. But these weren't ordinary bullets. They exploded.

BOOM! BOOM!

The house shook. Walls cracked. Pozzi ducked, covering his head with his hands. Two more explosions — and the roof collapsed inside, raising a cloud of snow and splinters.

— God damn... — Pozzi didn't finish when the house exploded completely.

He was thrown outside, tumbled across the snow. He jumped up, spitting, and ran away. Thunder came from behind — skeletons fired bursts, explosive bullets tore snow, ice, earth. Craters grew one after another.

Pozzi ran in zigzags, like a hare. Bullets whistled past, exploded left, right, behind. But skeletons, as if on purpose, turned out to be bad shots. Not one bullet hit the target, only raised snow fountains.

— Hey, bony! — Pozzi screamed while running. — Learn to shoot!

Skeletons got angry, fired even more fiercely, but to no avail. Pozzi zigzagged, dodged and gradually broke away.

He ran for a long time. Very long. Kilometer count in his head: 5, 10, 15, 20... Skeletons fell behind, their figures got smaller. Finally, at the 27th kilometer, immortality pills and molecule multiplier stopped working.

Pozzi tripped, fell face-first into the snow and couldn't get up. His body turned to cotton, legs refused to obey, lungs burned with fire.

— Can't... anymore... — he croaked, rolling onto his back.

Northern lights shimmered overhead. Somewhere far away, two kilometers away, skeletons stood. They were exhausted too. Their ranks thinned, some already crumbled right on the move. And then, before Pozzi's eyes, they began to fall — simply fall in a pile of bones right into the snow.

— What...? — he didn't understand.

Skeletons fell one after another. Those who still held on also began to fall apart. In a minute only a pile of bones remained from five hundred bone soldiers, slowly sinking under the snow.

— Range of action, — Pozzi guessed. — They can't go far from the portal. Or from uwogylu.

He tried to get up, but couldn't. His body refused to work. Pills ran out. He lay in the snow, looking at the northern lights, thinking: "So this is it? Is this where the furry-killer's story ends?"

uwogylu's red hologram still hung somewhere in the sky. It smiled.

— Interesting, — the voice rustled. — Made it. Almost. But without pills you're just meat. Freezing meat.

Pozzi closed his eyes. Snow cooled his cheek. His hand automatically reached for the notebook — to check if it was in place. The notebook was here. And number 1600 burned in it.

— Good number... — Pozzi whispered and lost consciousness.
