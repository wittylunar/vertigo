ch3-sp#7: Battle for Casino "May 9th"

"Arise, vast country, arise for a deadly fight..." thundered from the speakers.

Skeletons in Red Army uniforms rose from behind the machines. Officer caps sat jauntily on their skulls, a papirosa cigarette stuck in each mouth—not lit, of course, but for atmosphere. In bony hands—Mosin-Nagant rifles, aimed at uninvited guests.

— For the Motherland! — the first skeleton screeched, and they opened fire.

Bullets whistled past ears. Pozzi dove behind a column, Bill rolled under the nearest machine.

— What a reception! — Bill shouted, pulling a handful of bullets from his pockets. — They're seriously tuned!

— And you doubted? — Pozzi shouted back. — It's their casino!

He poked out from behind the column and pressed the trigger.

BOOM!

The "For the Motherland! For Stalin!" grenade launcher worked gloriously. The shell flew straight into a group of skeletons, scattering them into a pile of bones. Caps flew to the sides, papirosas fell to the floor.

— Sacred War plays louder—

— Yes! — Pozzi shouted. — Take that, Red Army men!

But there were many skeletons. They advanced from all sides, shooting on the move. Bill, lying under the machine, started throwing bullets. Not shooting, but exactly throwing—and with amazing accuracy.

— Take this! — he shouted, launching a magazine into the nearest skeleton's head. The skull shattered, the body collapsed.

— More! — the next magazine knocked a cap off another, and along with it the head.

— You're a sniper! — Pozzi was admiring, reloading the grenade launcher.

— I'm a bullet-man! — Bill answered proudly. — I'm on "you" terms with bullets!

The second grenade launcher shot took out three more. One skeleton caught fire—apparently a spark hit the papirosa, and now he ran around the hall, waving his hands and scattering as he went.

— ...damn you, damn you... — the music continued playing, drowning out the shooting.

— How many of them there? — Pozzi shouted, looking out.

— Many! — Bill answered, launching another magazine into a skeleton with sergeant stripes. — But we'll manage!

They fought for about ten minutes. Pozzi fired from the grenade launcher until shots ran out, then took out his gun and started shooting with bullets Bill supplied him. Bill threw magazines like a professional baseball player, knocking down skeletons one by one.

Finally the last Red Army man collapsed, scattering into bones. Silence reigned in the hall, only the gramophone still croaked:

"Arise, vast country..."

Pozzi approached the speaker and pulled out the wire. Music fell silent.

— Phew, — he exhaled, wiping sweat. — What a bathhouse.

Bill crawled out from under the machine, brushing himself off. His pockets noticeably slimmed.

— I used up almost all bullets, — he complained. — Need to replenish the supply.

— And here's replenishment, — Pozzi nodded at the pile of bones, among which rifles and bullet pouches lay.

They quickly gathered trophies. Bill stuffed his pockets, Pozzi reloaded his gun and grenade launcher (no more shells, but bullets were enough).

— Where next? — Bill asked.

— There, — Pozzi pointed at a door at the far end of the hall with a sign "EXIT."

They approached the door, pushed. Behind it was a staircase. Down. With a sign "-2."

— Minus second? — Bill was surprised. — How many underground floors are there here?

— We'll find out, — Pozzi shrugged. — Let's go.

They stepped into the darkness, and behind their backs, in the "May 9th" casino hall, piles of bones and empty casings remained lying. Somewhere in the corner, the last officer's cap still burned.
