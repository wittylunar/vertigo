ch5-arg#6: Escape on Water

Pozzi trudged through the snow, barely moving his legs. Pills ran out, his body worked on pure stubbornness. Eyes drooped, but adrenaline drove him forward. And suddenly two hundred meters ahead, against the icy shore, he saw a boat.

An ordinary motorboat, slightly covered with snow, but looked intact. Tied to a rusty pier, swaying on cold waves.

— Oh, — Pozzi exhaled, picking up the pace. — This is a chance.

He crawled to the boat, untied the rope, jumped inside. Keys? No keys. But wiring stuck out — apparently the owners didn't bother much. Pozzi found the wires, shorted them, the motor sneezed and started.

— Yes!

And at that moment a crash came from behind. Pozzi turned around. Red optimuses, who had already gone far, suddenly froze, synchronously turned and stared in his direction. Their optical sensors flashed brighter.

— Running engine detected, — one roared. — Target identified. Pursue!

Twenty red giants turned and dashed to the shore at race car speed. Snow rose behind them in fountains.

— GOD DAMN IT! — Pozzi screamed and gunned the motor to full.

The boat dashed into the open ocean. Waves hit the side, icy spray flew in his face, but Pozzi didn't let go of the tiller. Blaster beams struck from the shore behind. Fireballs whizzed overhead, fell into the water, boiling with steam.

— Missers! — Pozzi screamed, dodging.

One beam grazed the stern — plastic melted, but the boat held on. Optimuses went into the water, but apparently couldn't swim — sank to their chests and got stuck, continuing to fire after.

Pozzi went further away. The shore faded behind the stern, red figures became dots, then disappeared completely.

He sailed for an hour, two, three. The motor ran smoothly, there was apparently plenty of gasoline. The ocean changed color from gray to blue, then to turquoise. It got warmer. Pozzi took off his jacket, remaining in his plaid shirt.

— Where am I being carried? — he mumbled, looking at the horizon.

Finally land appeared. Yellow, sandy, with palm trees and some buildings. A city with minarets and destroyed buildings was visible in the distance. An inscription on a crooked sign read: "IRAQ — WELCOME".

— Iraq, — Pozzi whistled. — Quite a route. From the Arctic — straight to the desert.

He looked around, checking the notebook. Number 1600 still burned. Pozzi brushed sand off his clothes and walked toward the city.

— Hope there are no furries here, — he said. — Because I'm already tired.

But new surprises awaited him in Iraq.
