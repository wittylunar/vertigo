ch9-dm#3: Library of Worlds

Pozzi read, and lines came alive. There he kills furries, there he fights skeletons, there he flies in space.

— Archive? Library of all lives?

— Not only yours, — Luna appeared nearby. — All characters of Vertigo.

She waved her hand — shelves appeared. To the ceiling, to infinity. Books:

"Pozzi. Vol. 1-7", "MORGENSTERN. Drafts", "Bill. Complete Collection", "Skeletons. Anthology"...

— Everything here?

— Everything. Every decision, every death.

— And where are the next chapters?

Luna pointed to empty shelves.

— Not yet written. You must write them.

— I'm not a writer. I'm a killer.

— You're both. Every kill is a line. Every level is a chapter.

She took a book: "Pozzi. Vol. 8. Draft".

— Your next chapter. Write it.

— I have to write it?

— No. Live it.

She closed the book, returned it to the shelf.

— Go. Next level. 300th. There you'll learn the truth about Vertigo.

— What truth?

— The one the author didn't have time to write.

Luna disappeared. Pozzi alone among shelves.

Took his notebook, looked at the number 1. Ran to the exit.
