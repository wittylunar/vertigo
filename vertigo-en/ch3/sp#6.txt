ch3-sp#6: Casino "May 9th"

Pozzi and Bill Phil Patronafil briskly walked down the staircase. Bullets in Pozzi's pockets pleasantly clinked, mood improved. Walking together was more fun—Bill constantly told stories about his trips to different floors.

— ...and on the 57th I found a whole bullet warehouse, — he said, waving his hands. — Imagine? Crates, crates, to the ceiling! But all empty. Someone got there before me.

— And where did you come from anyway? — Pozzi asked. — I've seen so much here, but met you for the first time.

— I'm everywhere a little, — Bill evasively answered. — Where bullets are—there I am. And bullets, you know, are everywhere. Even where they shouldn't be.

They descended several more flights and finally saw a door with a sign "1."

— First! — Pozzi was delighted. — Well finally!

He pushed the door, and they exited onto a landing pad. A helicopter stood there. But not that shiny military one, but old, rusty, with peeling paint. Blades were in place, but there was no engine inside. Empty interior, only seats and an instrument panel without buttons.

— What a piece of crap, — Bill whistled. — No engine. Can't even charge with bullets.

— And no dispatcher, — Pozzi added. — Seems another disappointment.

They stood, looked at the useless helicopter, then at each other.

— What next? — Bill asked.

— Don't know, — Pozzi honestly answered. — Maybe back? There are still floors, we didn't pass them all.

— Any point? We came from 46th, there was nothing there.

— Well, suddenly?

They turned and went back to the staircase. Rose one flight—and froze. Instead of a door with a sign "2" there was another door. New, with a sign "-1."

— Minus first? — Bill was surprised. — Haven't seen this yet.

— Staircase to the basement? — Pozzi suggested. — Well, shall we go?

He pushed the door, and they entered.

It was dark inside, damp, and smelled of mold. Pozzi turned on his phone flashlight (the phone, by the way, somehow miraculously worked again) and illuminated the room.

It was a casino hall. But not modern, shimmering with neon, but old, Soviet. Shabby walls, faded posters "GLORY TO THE CPSU," rusty slot machines arranged in rows. A hammer and sickle sign hung above each machine.

Pozzi approached the nearest machine. It was a classic "one-armed bandit," only instead of fruits and diamonds on the reels were drawn red USSR flags, stars, and for some reason American flags resembling little bombs.

— What a theme, — Bill whistled. — Casino "May 9th," or what?

— Looks like it, — Pozzi pulled the lever. The machine screeched, reels spun and stopped: USSR flag, USSR flag, American flag. The machine poured out a handful of rusty tokens with Lenin's profile.

— Jackpot? — Bill snorted.

— More like a consolation prize, — Pozzi took a token, turned it. "1 bullet" was stamped on the back.

— Oh! — Bill perked up. — These tokens can be exchanged for bullets! There should be an exchange office somewhere here.

They walked further. A counter with a sign "CURRENCY EXCHANGE" stood in the corner of the hall. A skeleton in a budenovka hat and with a rifle sat behind the counter. A stack of the same tokens lay before him.

— This one won't exchange anymore, — Pozzi stated.

— And there's the exchange office, — Bill pointed at a machine to the side, resembling a vending machine. An inscription read: "INSERT TOKEN — GET BULLET." A pile of empty casings lay nearby.

Pozzi dropped a token into the slot. The machine hummed, screeched, and issued one bullet. A regular 9mm bullet.

— It works! — Pozzi was delighted. — Need more tokens!

They ran to the machines and started pulling levers. Machines screeched, spun, issued combinations. Pozzi won flags, then stars, then American bomb flags. In half an hour they gathered a whole handful of tokens.

— Enough, — Bill said. — Let's exchange.

They approached the vending machine and began dropping tokens one by one. The machine faithfully issued bullets of different calibers. Some were old, rusty, some shiny, like new.

— Interesting, who set all this up here? — Pozzi pondered, stuffing his pockets.

— Maybe those who skeletons, — Bill nodded at the budenovka. — Soviet furries? No, never heard of such.

Suddenly something hummed in the depths of the hall. One of the machines lit up, and an inscription appeared on its screen:

"YOU COLLECTED 100 TOKENS. GET SUPERPRIZE!"

A large box fell out of the machine. Pozzi opened it—a grenade launcher and three shots for it lay inside. "FOR THE MOTHERLAND! FOR STALIN!" was inscribed on the grenade launcher.

— Damn, — Bill exhaled. — This is not bullets.

— Now there's something to meet furries with, — Pozzi said contentedly, slinging the grenade launcher over his shoulder.

They were already about to leave when suddenly music started playing from speakers hung around the hall. Old, gramophone, with crackling:

"Arise, vast country, arise for a deadly fight..."

Light flickered, and figures began rising from behind the machines. Skeletons in Red Army uniforms, with rifles, with red stars on pilot caps. They moved slowly but relentlessly.

— Oh, — Bill said. — Seems we woke up the ghosts.

— Fine, — Pozzi racked the grenade launcher. — Now I have something to answer with.

And the battle in the Soviet casino began.

(To be continued...)
