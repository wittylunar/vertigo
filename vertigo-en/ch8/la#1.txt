ch8-la#1: Reboot

Pozzi lay on Miami beach, sun warming his face, waves rustling nearby. He opened his eyes — and realized it was a dream.

All this rest, surfing, friends — everything disappeared. He was on the staircase again. Gray walls, dim lamps, smell of dampness.

— What the hell? — he mumbled.

A sign on the wall: "FLOOR 0. VERTIGO 2.0".

A voice from the speaker:

— Welcome to Vertigo 2.0. All saves deleted. Counter zeroed.

— NO! — Pozzi screamed. — I killed 1621!

— Error. Actual count: 0.

Pozzi reached for the notebook — pages empty. Only "0" on the cover.

— Who are you?! — he shouted.

A girl in a white dress appeared from the air.

— I'm Luna. System administrator. You killed too much. System is full. Have to start over.

— I won't!

— You must. New quest: reach floor 100. Reward: notebook return.

She disappeared. Pozzi cursed and began his descent.

(To be continued...)
