ch3-sp#4: Sleeper

The helicopter flew over the ocean. Two dispatchers sat next to each other—one at the controls, the second in the passenger seat, and both were silent, eyeing each other. Pozzi sat behind and looked at them with interest.

— So how are you going to figure it out? — he asked.

— I'm the real one! — both said in unison.

— Uh-huh, — Pozzi smirked. — Just like in that movie about twins.

The helicopter had been flying for 50 minutes. Not much remained to Miami. At the 54th minute, one of the dispatchers—the one who'd been with Pozzi in the gym—suddenly turned pale, clutched his heart, and began to topple over.

— Hey! — Pozzi shouted. — What's wrong?

— I... I don't... — the dispatcher whispered, and suddenly he swayed. The helicopter door, poorly closed after the crash, swung open, and the dispatcher fell out.

— NOOOO! — the second screamed, lunging for the door, but it was too late. The body disappeared into the clouds.

Pozzi looked down but saw nothing.

— Now that's a twist, — he said. — Why are you screaming? It's not you who fell.

— But it was me! — the remaining dispatcher sobbed. — Or rather, not me, but... I don't know! Who am I now?

— We'll figure it out on the ground, — Pozzi cut off. — How long to fly?

— Three minutes.

In three minutes the helicopter softly descended onto the landing pad next to Pozzi's house. Palm trees, ocean, sun—everything was in place. No gray fog, no staircases.

— Well, — Pozzi said, climbing out. — Let's go. Let's see what's there.

They approached the door. Pozzi pushed—open. Inside was clean, cozy, smelled of food. An old calculator lay on the table in the living room—the very one Jeff sat with. But Jeff himself wasn't there.

— Hello! — Pozzi shouted. — Anyone home?

Silence. Then he went to the bedroom. Opened the door and froze.

A person slept on the bed, covered with a blanket. In a plaid shirt, with brown hair, with a notebook on the nightstand. It was HIM. Pozzi. The very Pozzi who now stood in the doorway.

— What? — Pozzi exhaled.

The sleeper suddenly opened his eyes. Looked straight at the standing Pozzi. And smiled.

— Hello, — the sleeper said. — You took long.

— Who are you? — Pozzi stepped back.

— I am you, — the sleeper answered, sitting on the bed. — And you are me. We're one and the same. You were away, and I lay here, rested.

— How so? — Pozzi didn't understand.

— Very simple, — the sleeper stretched. — You've been sleeping all this time. Or rather, we slept. And everything you saw—furries, staircases, casinos, dispatchers—it was a dream. A long, strange dream.

— No, — Pozzi shook his head. — Can't be. I remember everything. I killed 1538 furries. I got a notebook!

— The notebook was also a dream, — the sleeper smirked. — Look in your pocket.

Pozzi stuck his hand in his pocket. No notebook.

— Where?.. — he went cold.

— There, — the sleeper nodded at the nightstand. — Your notebook's been lying here all this time. You just slept and saw dreams.

Pozzi approached the nightstand, took the notebook. Opened it. Pages were empty. Not a single number, not a single entry.

— But how?.. — he whispered.

The sleeper stood, approached him, put a hand on his shoulder:

— Time to wake up, brother.

And pushed.

Pozzi flew into darkness. Tumbled, fell, and suddenly...

— A-a-a! — he sat on the cold floor, gasping for air.

He sat in the gym. The very one, with the crashed helicopter, wall bars, and mats. A number glowed on the wall: 46.

— 46th floor, — Pozzi whispered. — Again?

He looked around. No one was around. Only on the bench where the child used to sit, now lay a skeleton. Human, in clothing remains. An old phone with a cracked screen lay nearby.

Pozzi approached, picked up the phone. The screen lit up. A message was on it:

"You woke up 67 times. This was the 68th. Dispatcher died 54 minutes ago. His skeleton is on the 46th floor. Go on."

— Dispatcher... — Pozzi turned to the skeleton. — Is that you?

The skeleton was silent. Only the skull looked with empty eye sockets.

Pozzi took out his notebook. It was with him again, and number 1538 was in place. So dream is also reality? Or reality is a dream?

— Fine, — he sighed. — We'll figure it out later. But now—need to go.

He looked at the door with the sign "46," then at the staircase down.

— Dispatcher is dead. I'm alone again. And this gym... how many times?

He kicked the skeleton, it crumbled to dust.

— Sorry, — Pozzi said. — You were a good dispatcher. Even two times.

And stepped onto the staircase. Down, into the unknown.
