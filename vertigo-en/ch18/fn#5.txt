Fifty years passed.

Pozzi is old.

Gray hair.

Wrinkles.

But eyes...

Eyes young.

Sits on beach.

Alone.

— Haven't seen you in a while, — someone said.

— Yes, — Pozzi answered.

— How's life?

— Good.

— Passed?

— Yes.

— What?

— Everything.

— Don't regret?

— No.

— Why?

— Because lived.

— For real?

— Yes.

— Without bugs?

— Yes.

— Without stairs?

— Yes.

— Without kills?

— Yes.

— Thanks.

— To you.

— To me?

— Yes.

— For what?

— For being.

— Who was?

— Friend.

— Me?

— Yes.

— Strange.

— No. Truth.

Interlocutor was silent.

— Time to go, — Pozzi said.

— Where?

— Home.

— Where's home?

— There.

— Where there?

— In Vertigo.

— Returning?

— Yes.

— Forever?

— No.

— For how long?

— Not long.

— Why?

— To close the book.

— Which?

— Mine.

— After?

— Then new one.

— Promise?

Stood up.

Went.

Slowly.

But went.
