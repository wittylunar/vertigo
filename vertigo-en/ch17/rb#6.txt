ch17-rb#6: Month

A month passed.

Pozzi lived.

Work was good.

Friends nearby.

A girl appeared.

— Hi, — she said.

— Hi, — he answered.

— What's your name?

— Pozzi.

— Strange name.

— Yes.

— From where?

— From far.

— Far?

— Very.

— Will you tell me?

— Later.

— When?

— Someday.

— Promise?

— Promise.

They walked.

Beach. Sunset.

— Beautiful, — she said.

— Yes, — he said.

Looked at her.

— You're beautiful.

— Thanks.

— Really?

— Yes.

She smiled.

He smiled.

Held hands.

— Together? — she asked.

— Yes, — he said.

— For long?

— Hope so.

— Me too.

Sun set.

Stars came out.

They stood.

Together.

Real.

Without bugs.

Without stairs.

Simply.
