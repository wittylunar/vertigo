ch11-vs#6: Mountains

Level 800 was mountains. High peaks, snow, glaciers.

— Cold, — Pozzi said.

— Stay closer, — Luna took his hand.

They walked on the path. Wind blew, but they held on.

— Why mountains? — Pozzi asked.

— Because need to climb to see the path.

— What path?

— To 1800th.

— You know something?

— I guess.

A ravine ahead. Bridge over it — old, wooden.

— Reliable? — Pozzi asked.

— We'll check.

Luna stepped. Bridge held.

They crossed. A cave on the other side.

— Entrance to 900th, — she said.

— Why a cave?

— Because the next test is inside.

— What's there?

— Don't know. But you'll handle it.

— Why?

— Because you're Pozzi.

They entered the cave.

Darkness swallowed them.
