ch14-nf#6: Return

Pozzi walked on the beach. People watched.

— Hey, Pozzi! — someone shouted.

He turned. A friend. Real.

— Hello!

— Where have you been? Haven't seen you in ages!

— Traveling.

— Far?

— Very.

— How was it?

— Long.

— Will you tell us?

— Later.

— Let's go to the beach!

— Now.

Pozzi sat on sand.

Friend left.

Pozzi looked at the ocean.

Everything over.

No stairs.

No bugs.

Only him.

And ocean.

— Home, — he said.

Notebook in pocket.

Warm.

— Last time.

He opened.

Wrote:

"Pozzi returned home. To Miami. No bugs. No stairs. No kills. Just lived."

Closed.

Put away.

Stood up.

Went to friends.

Sun set.

End.

Or beginning?

(To be continued...)
