ch4-wi#2034: President of Albania

The helicopter flew in the gray sky. The dispatcher breathed heavily, glancing at the instruments. Pozzi sat in the back, sorting cartridges and looking out the window — wondering if Venom's black shadow would appear.

— Much longer? — he asked.

— Don't know, — the dispatcher answered honestly. — I don't even understand where we are. Compass is dead, altimeter is lying. But seems like there's some land ahead.

— Main thing is no skeletons and no Venom.

And at that moment a whistle was heard. The dispatcher jerked, Pozzi looked out the window and managed to see a missile flying from somewhere below. Thermal. With a red light.

— TURN AWAY! — he screamed.

Too late. The missile hit the helicopter's tail. Explosion, flame, metal screech. The dispatcher flew out of the seat, hit his head on the instrument panel and froze.

— Dispatcher! — Pozzi shouted, but he didn't answer. Eyes glazed over.

The helicopter spun like a top and rushed to the ground. Pozzi grabbed the seat, but he was thrown out of the broken door. He tumbled through the air, hit something soft and rolled.

BOOM! The helicopter crashed into the building behind and exploded.

Pozzi lay on the floor, deafened. Everything around smelled of burning, something was crackling. He got up with difficulty, felt himself — seemed intact. Immortality pills and molecule multiplier saved him again.

— Where am I? — he mumbled, looking around.

It was a room. Ordinary, with a carpet, heavy curtains on the windows. A huge oak table stood in the middle, and a person sat in a chair behind it. More precisely, he hung, leaning back in the chair. In a suit, with a tie, a neat bullet hole in his forehead.

A note lay on the table next to him: "President of Albania. No longer needed".

— Holy shit, — Pozzi exhaled. — I'm in Albania? And they just shot the president?

And then he saw it. Under the table, duct-taped to the leg, lay a bomb. A real one, with a timer. Red digits relentlessly counted down:

00:06... 00:05... 00:04...

— GOD DAMN IT! — Pozzi screamed.

He rushed to the bomb, yanked the wires — no, doesn't come apart. Tried to tear off the duct tape — sticky. Timer showed 00:03.

Pozzi looked around for an exit. Window! He rushed to the window, opened the sash. Unknown below, but no time to choose.

00:02.

— Jumping!

00:01.

Pozzi jumped out the window.

00:00.

BOOM!

The explosion threw him out of the window along with pieces of wall. Pozzi flew down, tumbling, and a second later splashed into some garbage container. Debris, dust, some paper fell from above.

— Alive, — he croaked, crawling out of the container. — How many times already...

He brushed himself off, checked the notebook. It was in place. Opened it — number 1583 still burned. Pozzi wrote:

+1 (dispatcher) = 1584
+1 (President of Albania — didn't kill him, but was nearby) = 1585

— Albania, huh, — he grinned, looking at the destroyed city. — Where's the casino here?

Sirens wailed somewhere in the distance. Pozzi sighed and walked toward where lights were visible. New country, new adventures. And Venom was probably somewhere nearby.
