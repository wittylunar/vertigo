ch3-sp#1: Airspace

The helicopter flew through gray fog for about twenty minutes. Dispatcher silently looked at instruments that showed complete nonsense. Pozzi drummed his fingers on the armrest and stared into nowhere.

— Listen, — Pozzi broke the silence. — Maybe we're just circling in place?

— Don't know, — Dispatcher honestly answered. — Compass went crazy. Altimeter too. I don't even understand where up is, where down.

— Let me, — Pozzi leaned over him and pressed the first button he saw.

Fog outside the glass suddenly cleared. The helicopter emerged into bright blue sky, under which an ocean stretched, and a coastline was visible in the distance.

— Wow! — Dispatcher exclaimed. — It worked!

— I'm a wizard, — Pozzi said contentedly. — Where are we flying?

— Uhh... there, seems like USA, — Dispatcher looked closer at the map on the tablet, which suddenly came to life. — We're over the Atlantic, heading to Florida.

— Great, home! — Pozzi was delighted.

But joy didn't last long.

Somewhere to the left a growing hum sounded, and within a second an F-22 fighter jet flew past, almost hitting the helicopter with its wing.

— What the?.. — Dispatcher didn't finish when a second fighter approached from the other side.

A stern voice spoke over the radio:

— Unidentified helicopter, you have violated US airspace. Immediately follow us for landing at the nearest airbase. In case of non-compliance—we open fire.

— We're on your side! — Dispatcher shouted into the radio. — We're Americans! We got...

But fighters were no longer listening. Apparently, a helicopter without identification marks, emerging from nowhere, seemed too suspicious to them.

— Evade! — Pozzi shouted.

Dispatcher yanked the control stick down, trying to dive toward water, but fighters were faster. One of them fired a missile.

— HOLD ON! — Dispatcher screamed.

The missile hit the tail. The helicopter spun like a top, losing debris. Pozzi clung to the seat, Dispatcher tried to maintain control, but it was too late.

— WE'RE FALLING!

Earth rapidly approached. Trees flashed below, then some roof, and the helicopter crashed into a building.

CRASH!

Glass, concrete, metal—everything mixed together. Pozzi flew out of the seat, broke through the door with his head, and tumbled across the floor covered in debris.

When the world stopped spinning, he barely got up and looked around.

They'd fallen into a gym. A real gym with basketball hoops, wall bars, and mats on the floor. Helicopter wreckage smoked in the center of the hall, scattering pieces of metal and plastic around.

— Dispatcher! — Pozzi shouted.

Dispatcher's head appeared from the cabin, then his head, smeared with soot.

— Alive, — he croaked. — Where are we?

— In a gym, — Pozzi answered. — Looks like a school or fitness center.

Dispatcher climbed out of the wreckage, brushed himself off. No one was around, only smoke and smell of burning.

— They'll definitely search for us, — he said. — Fighters saw the crash. We gotta get out.

— Where? — Pozzi pointed at the doors. — Exit is there.

They headed for the exit, but suddenly sounds came from the locker room. Someone was there. And judging by the sounds—not alone.

Pozzi tensed. Hand reached for the belt where the last MORGENSTERN gun hung (he managed to pick it up before leaving the helicopter).

— Quiet, — he whispered to Dispatcher. — I'll check.

He crept up to the locker room door, peeked inside through the crack.

There, on benches, sat... furries. About ten of them, in sportswear, with tails and ears. They discussed something, not noticing smoke and crash.

— Again? — Pozzi exhaled. — They're everywhere?

He turned to Dispatcher:

— We got guests. Furries. In the locker room.

— Come on, — Dispatcher's eyes widened. — Where are they from here?

— What's the difference, — Pozzi took out his gun. — Main thing is they exist. And if they exist—they'll be in the notebook.

He pushed the door and stepped inside.

— Nobody move! This is a cleanup!

Furries turned around, and a familiar red glow ignited in their eyes.

— Him again! — one squealed. — Get him!

Shooting began.

Dispatcher pressed against the wall behind the door, and Pozzi with a smile pressed the trigger.
