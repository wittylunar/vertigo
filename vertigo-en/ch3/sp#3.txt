ch3-sp#3: Endless Gym

Pozzi descended the staircase, counting steps out of habit. One flight, second, third. Dispatcher trudged behind, breathing heavily and constantly looking back.

— Listen, — Dispatcher whispered. — Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?

— Doesn't seem like it, — Pozzi snapped. — We just entered.

— Well, look...

They descended another flight and bumped into a door. Pozzi pushed it and froze.

Before them was a gym. The very one they just left. Same wall bars, same mats, same crashed helicopter in the center of the hall. And even the child sat on the bench in the same place, nose in the phone.

— What the hell? — Dispatcher exhaled.

— Don't know, — Pozzi frowned. — But seems we're walking in circles.

The child raised his head. Smudged face, snot, saliva. He looked straight at Pozzi and suddenly said:

— And you're here again.

— What? — Pozzi was taken aback. — You remember me?

— You pass through here every five minutes, — the child answered indifferently. — Already a hundred times. Got annoying.

Pozzi and Dispatcher looked at each other.

— Every five minutes? — Pozzi repeated. — We only descended once!

— But for me it's already a hundred, — the child shrugged, not looking away from the screen. — Time is strange here. And the staircase is strange. I've been sitting here a year, but only five minutes passed on the phone.

— A year? — Dispatcher turned pale. — How a year?

— Just like that, — the child finally tore himself away from the screen and looked at them with cloudy eyes. — You can't get out from here. Only walk in circles. I already tried. Everywhere the same gym. Everywhere this helicopter. And you keep passing through.

Pozzi pondered. He took out his notebook, flipped through. Number 1538 was in place. So time still passes. But if the child is right...

— Fine, — he decided. — Then let's go not down, but up.

— Up? — Dispatcher was surprised. — Why?

— To check. If the same gym is below, maybe something else is above?

They turned and went up the staircase. Flight, second, third. Door. Pozzi pushed it.

Gym. The same one. Helicopter, wall bars, child on the bench.

— Hello, — the child said, not raising his head. — You again.

— Damn it, — Pozzi exhaled. — It's some kind of closed loop.

— Told you, — Dispatcher sighed and sat on the floor. — We'll never get out of here.

Pozzi stood in the middle of the gym, looked at the crashed helicopter, and thought. He didn't think long. Because an idea came to his head.

— What if not by staircase? — he said.

— What do you mean? — Dispatcher didn't understand.

— We keep walking the staircase. What if we try through a window? Or through a hole in the wall?

He approached the wall where he'd recently broken an opening. But there was no opening. The wall was intact, freshly concreted.

— Now this is interesting, — Pozzi knocked on the concrete. — So the staircase changes. Need to find another exit.

— What? — Dispatcher groaned. — There's only the staircase and gym here.

— Not only, — the child suddenly said, not looking away from the phone. — Sometimes a door appears. Over there.

He waved his hand to the corner where before there was only a wall. Now there really was a door there. Small, iron-clad, with a sign "1."

— First floor, — Pozzi read. — Well, let's risk it?

Dispatcher hopelessly nodded.

Pozzi pushed the door. Behind it was a staircase. Just one flight down. They descended and found themselves on a landing with a large number "1" on the wall.

— Well there, — Pozzi was delighted. — First floor! Now we'll exit and...

He pushed the door and went outside.

A landing pad was before him. And on it—a helicopter. Whole, unharmed, with a running engine. Dispatcher darted nearby—but not the one who'd been with him all this time, but another. New. Fresh.

— Oh! — the dispatcher shouted. — Finally! I've been waiting for you! Get in quick before the fighters return!

Pozzi turned around. The Dispatcher who'd been with him all this time stood with his mouth open, looking at his double.

— And who's this? — he asked.

— This is you, — Pozzi answered, taking out his notebook. — Seems we're in some kind of time loop again. And there's already two of you.

— How two? — the dispatcher didn't understand.

— Just like that, — Pozzi sighed. — Fine, we'll figure it out later on the ground. Now we gotta get out.

He grabbed both dispatchers by the scruff and dragged them to the helicopter.

— Both sit! We'll figure out who's real and who's a glitch during the flight.

The helicopter took off, carrying Pozzi and two identical dispatchers into the gray sky.

And in the gym the child remained sitting, nose in the phone. He raised his head, looked after the flying helicopter, and quietly said:

— Hundred and first time they've flown away. And they still return.

And again buried himself in the screen.
