ch1-cs#1: Jackpot

The helicopter slowly descended for landing. Below, Las Vegas sparkled with lights—real, not cardboard, not ghostly. Neon casino signs shimmered in all colors of the rainbow, Bellagio fountains shot into the sky, endless limousine lines crawled along the Strip.

— Beautiful, — Pozzi exhaled, pressing against the porthole.

The dispatcher nervously fiddled with his headphones and glanced at the passenger. He clearly couldn't wait to drop off this crazy guy in a plaid shirt and forget this nightmare like a bad dream.

The helicopter softly touched down on the landing pad right at the entrance to the main Strip casino. Doors opened, and Pozzi stepped onto the red carpet.

It was so red and so long that it stretched straight into the building, like in movies about Hollywood stars.

— Wow, what a reception, — Pozzi whistled.

And then they started photographing him. Paparazzi jumped out from everywhere, flashes clicked, someone shouted: "Pozzi! Pozzi, over here!" Girls in sequins waved, men in expensive suits respectfully parted.

Pozzi walked the red carpet, feeling like a movie star. He adjusted his collar (the plaid shirt was indeed not fresh after all the troubles), smoothed his hair, and stepped inside.

The casino buzzed. Thousands of machines, dozens of tables with roulette, blackjack, poker. Waitresses carried free cocktails, croupiers skillfully threw chips, players screamed with delight and despair.

Pozzi approached a roulette table. The croupier—a bald guy in a bow tie—politely smiled:

— Place your bets, sir.

Pozzi reached into his pocket. He had no money. None at all. But instead of money, his hand felt that very radio that came alive on the 500th floor and on the 200th. Now it was cold and dead.

— Um, — Pozzi said. — Can I bet this?

The croupier looked at the radio, then at Pozzi, then back at the radio. Shrugged:

— The casino accepts any bets, sir. What are you betting on?

— On danger, — Pozzi said confidently.

— Excuse me, sir? — the croupier didn't understand.

— On DANGER! — Pozzi repeated louder. — Not on red, not on black. On DANGER!

A whisper ran through the hall. Players stopped playing and turned. Waitresses froze with trays. Even the machines stopped chiming.

The croupier helplessly looked at the radio, then at the roulette wheel, then back at Pozzi.

— Sir, there's no such bet in the rules...

— Just spin it! — Pozzi snapped.

The croupier, obeying some unknown force, spun the roulette. The ball jumped across cells, clattered, slowed...

And stopped right between red and black. Where it couldn't possibly stop.

The display lit up with an inscription:

DANGER

The casino exploded with applause. Bells rang, lights flashed, coins poured from the machines. Pozzi stood with his mouth open because chips, money, tokens flew at him from all sides.

— JACKPOT! — someone screamed. — HE HIT THE JACKPOT!

Pozzi started scooping up winnings by the armful, stuffing pockets, shirt, pants. There was so much money it fell back onto the floor, but Pozzi didn't care.

— Yes! — he roared. — I did it! Jackpot! Now I'm king!

And at that moment everything froze.

First the lights went out. Just like that—darkness. Then machines started glitching, displaying strange symbols instead of pictures. People froze like statues, and then began to melt, turning into skeletons right before his eyes.

— What? — Pozzi rubbed his eyes.

He blinked.

And when he opened his eyes, the casino was empty. Completely empty. No lights, no people, no money. Only dust, cobwebs, and skeletons. Many skeletons. They sat at tables, stood by machines, lay on the floor. Everywhere.

Pozzi looked at his hands. The money he'd just scooped up disappeared. Pockets were empty. Even the plaid shirt hung like a rag.

— Deceived, — he said quietly. — Deceived again.

He looked around. In the corner, where the exit to the red carpet used to be, a gaping hole now yawned. A rotten wooden door, crooked, with rusty hinges. A sign with numbers hung on the door:

355

— Three hundred fifty-five? — Pozzi repeated. — Is that a floor?

He approached the door, pushed it. It creaked open, and dampness, mold, and something else familiar wafted from inside. A staircase. A dark, endless staircase downward.

— Oh damn, — Pozzi sighed. — Stairs again. I just got off vertigo!

He turned back to the empty casino with skeletons. Then to the staircase.

— Fine, — he decided. — Since it says 355, that's where I'm going. Maybe there'll be a normal casino on the 355th floor? Without skeletons?

He took out his notebook. Number 1525 still adorned the last page. Pozzi added:

+SKELETS — DON'T COUNT, THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD

— Although, — he pondered, — if they get up...

He looked at the skeletons. They weren't getting up.

— Fine then.

Pozzi stuffed the notebook back, adjusted his torn shirt, and stepped through the rotten door.

The staircase met him with darkness, smell of dampness, and a quiet hum somewhere far below.

— 355, — Pozzi repeated, beginning his descent. — At least it's not 777. That's something.

Footsteps faded into the darkness, and the door slammed shut behind him. With a quiet creak.

And somewhere in the empty casino, among the skeletons, one machine suddenly came to life, displayed the word DANGER on the screen, and went dark again.
