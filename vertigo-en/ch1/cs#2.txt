ch1-cs#2: Bloody Inscriptions

Pozzi walked down the staircase, counting floors to himself. 350... 340... 335... Numbers flashed on signs, but nothing changed around him—same gray walls, same dim light bulbs, same silence broken only by his footsteps.

— What a maze, — he muttered. — First helicopters, then furries, then a casino with skeletons. And now stairs again. When will this end?

On floor 324 he noticed light. Not dim, but bright, almost blinding, pouring from a slightly open door with a sign "CASINO • HALL 7."

— Oh, another casino, — Pozzi perked up. — Maybe this one without skeletons?

He pushed the door and entered.

The hall was huge. Rows of slot machines, roulette tables, a bar counter—everything worked, everything glowed, quiet music played. But there were no people. No one at all. Only emptiness and that annoying light.

— Hello! — Pozzi shouted. — Anyone here?

Silence. Machines blinked, invited to play, but no one answered.

Pozzi walked further, and then his gaze fell on the walls.

Inscriptions. Bloody, uneven, as if written with a finger in agony.

On one wall in large letters:

BACK ROOM.......

On another, a bit further:

Y... AST......

— What? — Pozzi squinted. — Back room? Is that like a storage closet? And Y... AST... Maybe "You ast..."? Asthma? Or "Terrast"?

He approached closer, touched the inscription. The blood was still wet. Fingers turned red.

— Fresh, — Pozzi was surprised. — But no people. Where did everyone go?

He walked around the hall, looked behind the bar counter, into the storage closet—empty. Only someone's shoe and a broken glass lay on the floor.

— Strange, — Pozzi shrugged. — Well, fine. Not furries—and that's good.

He was already about to leave when suddenly one of the machines came to life on its own. Reels spun on the screen, and a combination came up:

DANGER DANGER DANGER

The machine poured out a handful of tokens that rolled across the floor with a clink.

Pozzi looked at the tokens. They were old, rusty, with a skull image.

— Nope, — he said. — I won't play. Already had a jackpot, I know how it ends.

He turned and went back to the staircase. But at the exit he paused, looked at the inscriptions once more.

— Back room, — he repeated. — Maybe it's some secret level? Like in those games where monsters are around the corner?

He snorted and pushed the door to the staircase.

Further floors went one after another, and each was like a casino. 320—a hall with poker tables, empty, but with working lights. 315—a row of machines, blinking, but without people. 310—a VIP room with scattered chips and another bloody inscription: DON'T LOOK BACK.

— I'm not looking, — Pozzi grumbled, passing by. — I only look down anyway.

On floor 305 he heard footsteps. Somewhere in the distance, in the darkness of the corridor, someone walked. Pozzi froze, listened. Footsteps approached then receded, but no one was visible.

— Hey! — he shouted. — Who are you?

Footsteps fell silent. Then a whisper came, so quiet words couldn't be made out.

Pozzi stood, waited, but nothing else happened.

— Nerves, — he decided. — From lack of sleep.

And he continued his descent.

Floor 300 met him with the smell of rot and lights turned off. Had to go by touch, holding the wall. Water dripped somewhere in the darkness, and a strange scraping sound could be heard, as if someone was scratching from inside the walls.

— Brrr, — Pozzi shivered. — Like some horror movie. And where are my eye lasers when you need them?

He tried to turn on prime mode, but eyes only weakly glowed and went out—apparently the battery died.

— Fine, we'll do it the old way.

On floor 298 lights turned on again, and Pozzi saw another casino hall. But now someone was in it. A figure in a hood sat at one of the tables, playing solitaire.

Pozzi tensed. The figure didn't move, didn't turn around.

— Hey, — he called. — Are you alive?

The figure slowly turned its head. Empty eye sockets looked at Pozzi from under the hood.

— Once was, — a voice rustled. — But you go on. They're waiting for you on 255.

— Who's waiting? — Pozzi asked.

But the figure had already returned to its cards and froze.

Pozzi stood, thought, waved his hand and went further. Didn't write it in the notebook—skeletons don't count.

The staircase went lower. 290... 280... 270...

On floor 265 he saw another door with a blood inscription: NO EXIT. But Pozzi knew there was an exit. Just had to reach the end.

Or the beginning.

Or somewhere else.
