ch15-gh#1: Ghost

Level 1500 met with fog. Thick, white, impenetrable.

— Where are we? — Pozzi asked.

— Level 1500 — City of Ghosts.

— Ghosts?

— Yes. Those who got stuck.

— Why stuck?

— Didn't accept the path.

— How to pass?

— Don't get stuck.

— How?

— Walk. Don't look back.

They walked. Figures emerged through fog.

— Who's this?

— Ghosts.

— Dangerous?

— No. But they talk.

— What about?

— What you want to hear.

— Why?

— So you stay.

— I won't stay.

— Know. But they'll try.

A figure came out of fog. A man.

— Pozzi... — he called.

— Who are you?

— Friend.

— I have no friends here.

— Had. Remember?

— No.

— Remember.

— Don't want to.

— Must.

— No!

Pozzi walked further.

Voices called.

He didn't listen.
