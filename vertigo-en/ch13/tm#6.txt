ch13-tm#6: Shadow

He stood in the clearing. Pozzi. But different.

Black eyes, notebook in hand, gun on shoulder.

— Hello, — he said.

— Hello, — Pozzi answered.

— Know who I am?

— Yes. Shadow.

— No. You. Real.

— I'm real.

— No. You're a dream. I'm reality.

— What's the difference?

— Dream believes in better. Reality kills.

— I don't kill.

— You did. 1621 times.

— That was...

— Necessary. To survive.

— Not necessary now.

— Always necessary.

Shadow raised the gun.

— Choice: you die or I die.

— No.

— Yes. One of us is extra.

— We're one.

— No. Different.

— Then let's merge.

— How?

— Accept each other.

Shadow was silent.

— Okay, — it said. — Accepted.

It stepped forward. Merged with him.

Pozzi flinched.

Strength. Memory. Everything.

— Thanks, — he said.

— You're welcome, — its voice said inside him.

He returned to the clearing.

— Ready, — the old man said. — 1700th is open.
