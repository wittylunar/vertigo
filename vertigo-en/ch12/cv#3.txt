Level 1000 was special. Huge hall, columns, throne in the middle.

— Level 1000 — Throne Room, — Luna said.

— Whose throne?

— Yours.

— Mine?!

— Yes. You passed halfway. This is the reward.

— I don't need a throne.

— I know. But it's yours.

Pozzi approached the throne. Golden, with patterns.

— If I sit — what happens?

— You'll become king of Vertigo.

— And then?

— You'll stay here. Forever.

— No.

— Then don't sit.

— But can I take something else?

— Can. What do you want?

Pozzi thought.

— Want to go home.

— Too early.

— How much more?

— 800 levels.

— Far.

— But possible.

He touched the throne. Throne disappeared, turned into a key.

— What's this?

— Key to doors. Will open 1800th.

— Thanks.

— You're welcome. Let's go.

— And the throne?

— Will stay here. For the next one.

They went further.

Throne glowed in the dark.
