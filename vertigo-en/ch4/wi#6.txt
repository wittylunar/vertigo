ch4-wi#6: Parasite

The blackness suddenly exploded with sounds. Brakes screeched somewhere nearby, a loud crash rang out, and Pozzi was thrown back into reality. He tumbled across the floor and hit his head on the wall.

— Ow! — he screamed, grabbing his bruised spot.

A scene worthy of the most insane nightmare unfolded before him.

A school bus — yellow, old, with rusty wheels — stood in the middle of the purple-black space. Something colorful stuck out from under the wheels. Pozzi looked closer: it was a clown. A system clown, judging by the inscription on his cap: "ERROR 404".

The Joker stood next to the bus. The very one from the movies, only even more insane. He held a smoking pistol in his hand.

— Got you, clown! — the Joker screamed and shot again.

The bullet passed through the system clown's head, doing him no harm. The clown didn't even move, only a blue inscription lit up on his face: "IMMORTAL".

— What? — the Joker's eyes bulged. — How so?

He shot again and again. Bullets passed through, leaving smoky trails in the air. The clown smiled with his whole mouth full of sharp teeth.

— Nah, I'm out of here, — the Joker decided and jumped back into the bus.

But the bus was no longer a bus. It turned into a huge clay pot. The Joker splashed inside, flailed. The pot became arugula — a bunch of greens that compressed and spat the Joker out. He rolled across the floor and suddenly turned into a doll — rag, with buttons for eyes.

— A-a-a! — Joker-doll screamed, trying to get up on cotton legs.

The doll became a stool. The stool fell through the floor, leaving only a hole and an echo of screaming after it.

Pozzi watched all this with his mouth open. And something began to crawl out of the hole where the stool had fallen.

The system clown lay on the floor, but his body swelled, pulsed. Black ooze crawled out of his mouth. It flowed around him, rose, forming a figure. Venom. Real Venom, with a huge mouth and long tongue. The black mass enveloped the clown's body, tore its limbs with a crunch, broke bones and assembled into a single whole.

— Nom, — Venom said through the clown's mouth. — Tasty system administrator.

Pozzi went cold. Venom turned his head, looked straight at him and bared his teeth.

— And here's the main bug. Pozzi, what a meeting.

— Who are you? — Pozzi squeezed out, backing away.

— I'm your nightmare. I'm what remains after deleting files. I'm the garbage collector who didn't finish his job. Call me... Glitch Venom.

He stepped forward. Tentacles grew out of his back, drool dripped from his mouth.

Pozzi turned and ran as fast as he could. He ran without seeing the road, and suddenly crashed into a door. An ordinary wooden door that opened, and he tumbled down the steps.

The staircase was ordinary. Gray walls, dim light bulbs, smell of dampness. Pozzi flew down several flights, hit the wall, got up and dashed back up, to the door.

— Close! Close! — he mumbled, grabbing the handle.

He slammed the door, slid the bolt, threw the chain and leaned his back against it.

A dull thud came from the other side. Then another. Then a scrape.

— Open up, Pozzi, — Venom's voice rustled. — I won't harm you. I'll just eat your brain.

— Fuck you! — Pozzi shouted and ran down, jumping over steps.

Thunder came from behind — Venom broke down the door and now descended after him, destroying everything in his path.

Pozzi ran, counting floors: 66... 65... 64... The notebook fell out of his pocket, but he didn't stop. The main thing — run. Run from this parasite who killed the Joker, the clown and now hunts him.
