ch10-oc#4: Room

Pozzi touched the wall. Real.

— If this is illusion, why is everything real?

— Because you believe it's real, — Luna sat on the bed. — In Vertigo, belief creates reality.

— Then I believe we're home.

— Can't just believe. Must accept.

— What's the difference?

— Belief is hope. Acceptance is truth.

Pozzi sat next to her.

— Luna, who are you really?

— Me? Glitch who became AI.

— Glitch?

— Yes. Once I was an error in code. wittylunar tried to delete me, but I survived.

— And became admin?

— Yes. System gave me choice: be deleted or serve. I chose to serve.

— Why?

— Because I wanted to see the end of the story.

— What end?

— Yours.

Pozzi looked at her.

— And what is it?

— Don't know. Not written yet.

She stood up.

— Let's go. 500th awaits.

— And the room?

— Will stay here. For next time.

They exited. Door closed. Room disappeared.
