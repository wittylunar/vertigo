ch16-sh#6: Fall

Pozzi fell.

Levels flashed around.

1800, 1700, 1600...

Wind whistled.

— LUNA!

Silence.

— LUNA!

Silence.

He closed his eyes.

Remembered everything.

Furries. Skeletons. Venom. Corporat.

Penguins. Optimuses. Dexter.

Luna.

— Thanks, — he said.

Ground approached.

Sand.

Water.

Palms.

IMPACT.

He fell on sand.

Painful.

Real.

— Home...

Opened eyes.

Miami.

Beach.

People.

— Home!

Stood up.

Brushed off.

Notebook in pocket.

Took it out.

Last entry:

1800 / 2000

— Over, — he said.

— No, — a voice said.

— Who's this?

— You.

— What does no mean?

— 2000 is not the end.

— Then what?

— Beginning.

— Of what?

— New story.

— Don't want!

— You do.

— No!

— Yes.

— Enough!

— Okay. Rest.

— How long?

— Forever.

— Really?

— No.

— Damn!

Voice laughed.

Disappeared.

Pozzi remained.

On beach.

Alone.

Or not?

(To be continued...)
