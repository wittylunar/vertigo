ch1-cs#7: Nuclear Sunset

Pozzi flew down the staircase, not feeling his legs. Thunder rumbled behind him—mutant 67-A was breaking out of the smashed capsule and following. Walls shook, plaster fell from above, and somewhere in the depths of the building a nuclear alarm siren was already howling.

— 50... 40... 30... — Pozzi counted, jumping over flights. — Just don't be late!

On the 20th floor he tripped over someone's corpse, rolled across the landing, jumped up and ran further. In his pocket, the capsule with grandpa's ashes clinked, the notebook flapped against his thigh.

15... 14... 13!

On the 13th floor he froze for a second—there really was a portal there, a glowing vortex leading to some other place. But the dispatcher said first floor. So it has to be first.

— Sorry, casino, — Pozzi exhaled and sprinted further.

12... 10... 8... 5... 3... 2...

First floor!

Pozzi burst through the door with his shoulder and flew outside. Before him was the landing pad, and on it—a helicopter. The very one, military, with a running engine. The dispatcher—the very one who brought him here—darted nearby.

— Where the hell have you been?! — the dispatcher shouted, grabbing Pozzi by the scruff and stuffing him into the helicopter. — Two hours I've been waiting! There's a bomb there! NUCLEAR!

— I was a bit delayed, — Pozzi croaked. — There was a mutant...

— I don't care! — the pilot was already taking off, blades spinning wildly. — Hold on!

The helicopter shot upward. Below, from the building doors, a huge mutant carcass was already crawling—tentacles, eyes, gaping maw. It roared, reached for the helicopter, but didn't reach.

— Made it! — the pilot shouted. — Getting out!

They gained altitude. And at that moment the building below flared up.

The nuclear explosion was beautiful. A huge orange ball shot into the sky, swallowing floors, the mutant, concrete walls, portals, the casino, and all 355 levels of this nightmare. The shockwave caught up with the helicopter, shook it, but the pilot handled it.

— Home, — the dispatcher said, wiping sweat. — You've fought enough, hero.

Pozzi leaned back in the chair, took out his notebook. Number 1526 still adorned the page. He added:

+1 (mutant 67-A, destroyed by bomb) = 1527

— 1527, — he whispered. — Good number. Almost like a jackpot.

He looked out the porthole. Below, where Las Vegas had been, an orange glow now blazed. The casino city disappeared in a nuclear mushroom cloud.

— And I never really got to play, — Pozzi sighed.

The dispatcher turned around, snorted, and handed him a bottle of water:

— You played big, kid. Heading home. To Miami.

— Miami? — Pozzi was surprised. — What about...

— That's it, — the dispatcher cut off. — Mission accomplished. Rest.

The helicopter flew through the night, carrying Pozzi away from danger. Somewhere in his pocket, the capsule with grandpa's ashes quietly clinked, new pages waited in the notebook, and a broken radio hung on his belt that would never come alive again.

— Hey, — Pozzi said after a pause. — What's your name?

— Dispatcher, — he answered. — Just Dispatcher.

— What's next?

— Next? — the dispatcher looked at the horizon where dawn was already breaking. — Next will be a new story. But that's not today.

Pozzi smiled, closed his eyes, and fell into sleep. Without dreams, without nightmares, without danger.

Just sleep.

Epilogue

Somewhere in the ruins of Las Vegas, among radioactive ash, a burnt sign lay: "HOUSE ALWAYS WIN." Wind turned it over, and it quietly clanked against the concrete.

And in Pozzi's pocket, in his notebook on the last page, next to number 1527, a new entry appeared, written in his own hand, though he didn't remember it:

"DANGER—THIS IS NOT THE END. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING."

(To be continued... someday)
