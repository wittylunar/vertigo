ch11-vs#1: Wasteland

Level 600 met them with dust. Ruins around, burnt buildings, dead earth.

— Level 600 — Wasteland, — Luna read the sign.

— Looks like post-apocalypse.

— After nuclear war.

— Whose?

— Doesn't matter. Let's go.

They walked through ruins. Wind howled, raising ash.

— Anyone here? — Pozzi asked.

— Yes. Survivors.

— Friendly?

— Depends.

A man came out of ruins. In gas mask, with rusty machine gun.

— Stop! Who are you?

— Travelers, — Luna said. — We need to get to 700th.

— 700th? There's death.

— We know.

— Then come here.

He pointed to a bunker.

— Shelter. Storm coming soon.

— What storm?

— Radioactive.

They went to the bunker. Wind intensified.

— Why is it like this here? — Pozzi asked.

— Because someone must remember, — the man said. — So it doesn't happen again.

They entered the bunker. Door closed.

Storm began.

(To be continued...)
