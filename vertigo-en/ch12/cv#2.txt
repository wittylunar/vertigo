ch12-cv#2: Charging

Pozzi jerked but didn't let go. Crystal glowed brighter.

— Hold it! — Luna shouted. — A bit more!

— Can't... hurts...

— You can! You're stronger!

Notebook in pocket glowed. Numbers ran: 11, 100, 500, 1000...

— What's happening?!

— Notebook is charging! Hold it!

Pozzi screamed. Light blinded.

Flash.

He fell to his knees. Crystal went dark.

— Did it work? — he asked.

— Yes. Look.

Pozzi opened the notebook. Pages glowed.

1000 / 2000

— Thousand?! From where?!

— Crystal gave power. Now you're halfway there.

— But I didn't kill...

— You did. But not only with sword. With word, choice, path.

— That counts?

— Yes. In Vertigo, everything counts.

— Thanks.

— Not to me. To the crystal.

— And to it?

— To it — nothing. It's just a tool.

— Like me?

— No. You're the master.

She helped him up.

— Let's go. 1000th awaits.
