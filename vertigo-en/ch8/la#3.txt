ch8-la#3: Hack

The car froze in the conference room. Glass and concrete flew everywhere.

— Quick! Three minutes until guards! — Rocky shouted.

Pozzi jumped out. Server room at the end of the corridor. Two cyborgs with machine guns at the door.

— I'll distract! — Rocky pulled out his pistol and opened fire.

Pozzi ran to the server room. Door locked, terminal nearby: "ENTER KILL COUNT".

— Kills? — Pozzi typed: 1621.

The door clicked and opened.

— It worked!

Inside, on a pedestal, lay a blue chip: "VERTIGO ACCESS KEY". Pozzi reached for it — time froze.

Bullets hung in the air. Luna appeared from nowhere.

— You remembered. 1621. Your real number.

— What's happening?

— System is testing you. You're ready.

She placed the chip in Pozzi's hand. Time resumed.

— Yes! Let's get out! — Rocky screamed.

Guards were running from behind — about twenty men.
