ch4-wi#-1234: Venom Ban and Africa Casino

Pozzi was running down the ruined street of an Albanian town when a black mass materialized right in front of him. Venom. He was grinning with his entire mouth, tentacles reaching toward Pozzi.

— Got you, bug, — he hissed. — Now I'll eat you, and your numbers will disappear from the notebook forever.

Pozzi stepped back, pressing the GTA 67 box to his chest. Venom opened his mouth, ready to swallow him whole, when suddenly...

BZZZZZZZT!

Venom twitched. His body began to flicker, covered with red stripes. He looked at his hands — they were melting like snow in the sun.

— What the... — he didn't finish when a huge inscription appeared right above him:

WARNING! USER "GLITCH_VENOM" IS BANNED FOREVER
REASON: MASS VIOLATION OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY LAWS
TERM: PERMANENT
COMMENT: STOP EATING SKELETONS, THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO

— NOOOOO! — Venom screamed, but he was already being sucked into a vortex. The black mass was thinning, disappearing, and in a second only a small puddle and a sign remained where the terrifying monster had been: "BANNED".

Pozzi exhaled. He looked at the sky — where Venom had just been. Then he looked at the street. In the distance, among the burnt buildings, a neon sign was burning:

AFRICA CASINO
ALL POPULATION — IN THE GAME!

— Africa? — Pozzi was surprised. — I'm in Albania. Whatever, don't care.

And he ran there. Violence of Africa? Whatever, the main thing is to make it in time.

The casino was huge, the size of a football field. Inside there were thousands of slot machines, and an African was sitting at each one. Literally the entire population of Africa — from Morocco to South Africa — was seated in this hall, pulling the levers.

— Jackpot! — some shouted.
— Bankrupt! — others screamed.

Pozzi ran up to a free machine, reached into his pocket and pulled out all the tokens he had. The inscription on the machine read: "BET — ALL POPULATION OF AFRICA".

— Well, here goes nothing, — Pozzi threw in the tokens and pulled the lever.

The reels spun. Elephants, baobabs, portraits of local chiefs and for some reason skeletons flashed on them. The reels stopped: skeleton, skeleton, skeleton.

LOSS. YOU LOST ALL POPULATION OF AFRICA.

— What? — Pozzi didn't understand. — How so?

The lights went out in the hall. All the Africans sitting at the machines began to melt, turning into dust. In a minute the hall was empty — only the wind blew between the empty chairs.

— I lost the population of an entire continent, — Pozzi slowly realized. — Cool.

And then the machines began to change. They were covered with rust, bones were crawling out of the cracks. In a minute the whole hall was filled not with slots, but with skeletons. Thousands of skeletons. In top hats, in tailcoats, with miniguns in their hands. And they were all looking at Pozzi.

One skeleton, taller than the rest, in a hat with a feather, stared at him with empty eye sockets. He had a minigun in his hands — huge, with a belt of cartridges that went into infinity.

— You lost Africa, — he grated. — Africa is us. We are Africa.

— But you're skeletons, — Pozzi tried to object.

— We overplayed in GTA, — the skeleton answered and pulled the trigger.

The minigun roared. Tracer bullets flew in all directions. The skeleton spun in place, spraying fire at the walls, ceiling, and neighboring skeletons. Thousands of skeletons with miniguns also opened fire.

— OH SHIT! — Pozzi screamed, diving under the nearest table.

Bullets whistled overhead. Skeletons fired without stopping — the cartridges were infinite. Everything around turned into a sieve.

Pozzi peeked out. Right in front of him, in the wall, a hole had formed. Cool air was coming from there and an inscription was visible: "ARTANKDIDADA" (apparently a typo, but Pozzi was no longer surprised).

— There! — he decided and dashed into the hole while the skeletons were busy shooting each other.

He flew into some tunnel and ran without looking back. Behind him everything was still thundering and rumbling — the skeletons had arranged an Apocalypse in the Africa Casino.

The notebook fell out of his pocket, opened to a page. Pozzi managed to notice a new number on the run:

+THOUSANDS OF SKELETONS (shot each other) = 1585 + ???

— I'll count later, — he decided and ran further.

(To be continued...)
