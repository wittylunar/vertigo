ch14-nf#2: Building

Level 1800 — building. Ordinary, gray, without decorations.

— Everything here? — Pozzi asked.

— Yes. Door inside.

— What door?

— Home.

They entered. Empty inside. Only a door at the end of the hall.

White, glowing.

— This is it, — Luna said.

— Why don't you open it?

— Not my door. Yours.

— Mine?

— Yes. Only you can open.

Pozzi approached. Touched.

Door warm.

— How to open?

— With the key.

— Key from the throne?

— Yes.

Pozzi took out the key. Inserted.

Turned.

Door began to open.

— Wait, — Luna said.

— What?

— If you open — no way back.

— I know.

— Think.

— Thought. Want to go home.

— And me?

— You...

Pozzi was silent.

— I'm not going with you, — Luna said.

— Why?!

— Because I'm part of Vertigo. Can't leave.

— But...

— Go. Alone.

(To be continued...)
