ch6-irk#1: Bomboclat

Pozzi trudged across the scorching desert. Sand crunched on his teeth, the sun baked mercilessly, his plaid shirt was soaked with sweat. After the icy Arctic this hell was especially contrasting.

— So where's the casino here? — he mumbled, wiping his forehead. — In Iraq too, probably? Or is there only oil and war here?

Some structure appeared in the distance. Huge, rusty, with pipes sticking out. A factory. Seemingly abandoned a hundred years ago, or maybe all six hundred.

Pozzi approached closer. Metal was covered with corrosion, walls rusted through, holes gaped somewhere. It was dark inside and smelled of machine oil mixed with mold. Pozzi went inside, squinting in the semi-darkness.

Workshops, machines, conveyors — all covered with a thick layer of rust and dust. No signs of life. Only the wind blew through broken windows.

A glass dome stood in the center of one workshop. Transparent, but just as rusty from the inside. A phone lay on a velvet cushion under the dome. Old, button-operated, with chipped paint. A sign lay next to it:

SAMSUNG BOMBOCLAT EDITION
LIMITED SERIES

— Bomboclat? — Pozzi was surprised. — What the hell?

He knocked on the dome. The glass rang pitifully. Pozzi looked for something to break it with, found a rusty rebar rod and hit the dome hard.

Crash! The glass shattered to pieces. Pozzi reached out, took the phone. It didn't even turn on — dead, like everything around.

— Why were you even lying here? — Pozzi turned it in his hands. — Ordinary rusty tube.

He was about to throw it away, but thought: "Maybe it'll come in handy?" And put the phone in his pocket, next to the notebook and other junk.

Then he went out of the factory, looked around. Desert, sun, not a soul. He got bored. Just throw the phone away, right?

He swung and threw the Samsung Bomboclat Edition far away. The phone flew away, gleaming in the sun, and disappeared over the horizon.

— Four hundred kilometers, no less, — Pozzi estimated, smiling contentedly. — Good throw.

He turned around to walk back to the factory, and froze.

Where the phone had flown, a fountain of sand, dust and flame shot up. Thunder rolled through a second later. When the dust settled, Pozzi saw a huge crater. About a hundred meters in diameter, no less.

— Holy shit, — he exhaled. — Phone... exploded? Or am I that strong?

He approached closer, looked into the crater. Something smoked at the bottom. And glowed. Red.

Figures began to rise from the smoke. Small, stocky, with machine guns. In rusty helmets, with gas masks on their faces. An inscription glowed on each one's chest:

BOMBOCLAT SQUAD

— Holy shit, — Pozzi only managed to say.

Bomboclats (or whoever they were) turned to him and opened fire.

Pozzi dashed back to the factory, dodging bullets.
