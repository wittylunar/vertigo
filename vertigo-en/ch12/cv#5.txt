ch12-cv#5: Memories

Level 1200 was strange. Rooms, corridors, doors.

— This is... my house? — Pozzi recognized wallpaper.

— No. Your memories.

— How so?

— Level stores memory.

They entered a room. Children's room. Toys, books, posters.

— This is my room, — Pozzi said quietly.

— Yes. Remember.

Pozzi sat on the bed. Flashes: mom, dad, laughter, birthday...

— I forgot...

— Now you remember.

— Why erase?

— Didn't erase. Hid. So it wouldn't interfere.

— What interfere?

— The path.

— Why go if you don't remember why?

— To remember.

— It's a vicious circle.

— Yes. But you almost out.

— How?

— 1800th. There you'll learn everything.

— Why there?

— Because that's the end.

— End of what?

— Story.

Pozzi stood up.

— Let's go.

— Rest.

— No. Want to go home.

— Then go. But remember — end is beginning.

— What?

— You'll see.

(To be continued...)
