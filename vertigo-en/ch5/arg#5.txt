ch5-arg#5: Red Optimuses

Pozzi woke up ten minutes later. His body ached, there was no strength to run at all. He with difficulty raised himself up, leaning on his elbows, then slowly got to his knees, brushing snow off his face.

— Alive, — he croaked. — What the hell am I still alive?

He got to his feet, swaying, and mechanically looked back, to where the skeletons crumbled. And froze.

Two kilometers away, in an even rank, they stood. Red, huge, with stern faces. Optimus Primes. Twenty of them. Blasters in their hands, aimed straight at Pozzi. Their red optical sensors burned in the twilight like predator eyes.

Pozzi's jaw dropped by itself.

— Optimus... Prime? — he whispered. — Twenty of them? Red? Are you kidding me.

Optimuses synchronously took a step forward. The earth shook.

Pozzi feverishly reasoned. Run? No, legs won't obey. Fight? With what? He only has an empty machine gun and a notebook. Hide? Where? Only snow and ice around.

And then it dawned on him. Snow!

He fell to his knees and began feverishly burying himself. With his hands, feet, his whole body he dug a snowdrift, burying himself deeper. In a minute only the top of his head remained above the surface, but Pozzi pulled that in too, breaking a passage under the snow.

Optimuses approached. Their steps thundered, shaking the earth. Pozzi lay under a half-meter layer of snow, trying not to breathe, not to move.

— Scanning, — a mechanical voice sounded overhead. — Weak biosignals detected. Probably local fauna.

— Ignore, — another answered. — Target — runaway bug with index 1585+. Continue search.

Heavy steps thundered right over Pozzi's head. Snow compacted, but held. Optimuses passed by, without even looking down.

Pozzi lay, counting to himself: one, two, three... twenty times red giants passed over him. Then steps began to fade away.

He waited another five minutes, then carefully stuck his head out. Optimuses walked toward the horizon, to where Pozzi had come from. They marched in even ranks, gleaming with red armor in the northern lights.

— They left, — Pozzi exhaled, crawling out of the snow and brushing himself off.

He took out the notebook. Hands shook from cold and adrenaline.

— Optimus Primes, — he muttered. — Twenty of them. Red. Didn't shoot. Passed by. Should I write in the notebook? They weren't killed.

He thought and wrote at the bottom of the page:

+0 (optimus primes — passed by, doesn't count)

— But if they come back, — he added aloud, — then we'll see.

He looked in the direction where the robots went, then in the other — there, far away, the red beam of the portal still burned, from which skeletons poured. And above all this hung the grinning hologram of uwogylu.

— Okay, — Pozzi sighed. — Time to move on. Before these tin cans come back.

He walked in the opposite direction, heading north, away from the portal, from skeletons, from optimuses and from this insane hacker in a gray hoodie.
