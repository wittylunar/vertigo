ch14-nf#5: Notebook

Notebook glowed. Last page:

1800 / 2000

— Missing 200?

— No, — voice inside. — Enough.

— Why?

— Because 2000 is a symbol. Full circle.

— Circle of what?

— Path.

— I passed?

— Yes.

— And now what?

— Live.

— Just live?

— Yes. No kills. No levels. No Vertigo.

— And notebook?

— Keep it.

— Why?

— Memory.

— Heavy.

— Yes. But yours.

Pozzi closed the notebook.

— Thanks.

— You're welcome.

— Who are you?

— Voice. In you.

— Luna?

— No. You.

— Me?

— Yes. Your will.

— Where is she?

— In Vertigo.

— Will we meet?

— Maybe.

— Goodbye.

— No. See you later.

Voice faded.

Pozzi remained alone.

On the beach.

Home.
