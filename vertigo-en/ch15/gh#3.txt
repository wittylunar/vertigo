ch15-gh#3: Wall

Pozzi entered the fog.

Cold. Painful. Scary.

Voices screamed:

— TRAITOR!

— YOU ABANDONED US!

— WE WERE FRIENDS!

— NO! — Pozzi screamed. — YOU WERE A SHADOW!

— WE WERE YOU!

— WAS! PAST TENSE!

He walked.

Step. Another step.

Pain intensified.

— STOP!

— CAN'T!

— YOU'LL DIE!

— ALREADY DEAD!

Last step.

Exit.

He fell to his knees.

Fog remained behind.

— Well done, — Luna said.

— Hurts.

— Passed.

— Yes.

— Let's go.

— Where?

— 1600th.

— What's there?

— Mountain.

— High?

— The highest.

— Why?

— To see the path.

— Which?

— Home.
