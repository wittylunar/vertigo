ch17-rb#2: Friends

Next day Pozzi walked around Miami.

— Hey! — someone shouted.

He turned. Friends ran to him.

— Where have you been?!

— Traveling.

— Far?

— Very.

— Will you tell us?

— Later.

— Let's go to a cafe!

— Let's go.

They sat in a cafe. Laughter. Jokes. Life.

— You changed, — a friend said.

— How?

— Became... calmer.

— Had a hard path.

— Worth it?

— Yes.

— Why?

— Because understood.

— What?

— What's important.

— What's important?

— This.

Pozzi gestured with his hand.

Cafe. Friends. Laughter.

— Yes, — friend said. — This is important.

They sat until evening.

Sun set.

— Time to go, — Pozzi said.

— Where?

— Home.

— See you tomorrow?

— Yes.

— Promise?

— Promise.

— Then see you tomorrow!

— See you tomorrow.

He walked home.

Smiled.

For the first time.

For real.
