ch10-oc#1: Ocean

Pozzi and Luna walked up the stairs. 300, 301, 302...

Suddenly steps ended. Below — endless ocean.

— What the...

— Level 350, — Luna said. — Ocean of oblivion.

— How do we cross?

— Need a boat.

She whistled. A submarine rose from the water. Black, with "NAUTILUS" inscription.

— Get in.

They went inside. Luna sat at the helm.

— Hold on. It'll be deep.

Submarine dived. Darkness around, only fish glowing.

— Where are we going?

— To the bottom. Portal to 400th there.

— Why bottom?

— Because Vertigo is not only up. Sometimes need to go down.

Depth gauge: 1000m, 2000m, 3000m...

— How much more?

— 11000.

Suddenly something hit the hull. Alarm wailed.

— What was that?!

— Kraken, — Luna said calmly.

— KRAKEN?!

— Don't worry. He's friendly.

— Friendly KRAKEN?!

— Yes. He'll guide us.

Tentacle wrapped the submarine and pulled down.
