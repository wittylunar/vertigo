ch17-rb#5: Dream

After a week, had a dream.

Stairs. Gray. Familiar.

— No, — Pozzi said. — Don't want to.

— Don't want what? — Luna asked.

— Back there.

— Won't go.

— Where are you?

— Here.

— Where here?

— In you.

— What do you mean?

— In memory.

— Why?

— To remind.

— About what?

— What's real.

— What's real?

— This.

— Dream?

— No. Life.

— Sure?

— Yes.

— How to check?

— Wake up.

— What if I don't wake up?

— You will.

— Promise?

— Promise.

Pozzi closed his eyes.

Woke up.

Morning.

Sun.

Birds.

— Home, — he said.

— Home, — echo confirmed.

Stood up.

Washed.

Dressed.

Went out.

Day began.

Ordinary.

Real.

Without bugs.
