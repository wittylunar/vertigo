ch12-cv#1: Cave

Dark in the cave. Pozzi turned on flashlight — beam showed walls.

— Level 900 — Cave, — Luna read.

— Why so dark?

— Because light is inside.

— Where?

— In you.

Pozzi closed his eyes. Eyes glowed red. Lasers lit the cave.

— Better?

— Yes. Let's go.

They walked. Cave wound like a snake.

— How far?

— To the end.

— And where's the end?

— Where it begins.

— What does that mean?

— You'll see.

Light ahead. Small, blue.

— What's there?

— Crystal.

They approached. Crystal in the center of cave, glowing.

— This is the heart of Vertigo, — Luna said.

— Heart?

— Energy source.

— Why are we here?

— To charge the notebook.

— How?

— Touch the crystal.

Pozzi touched. Electric shock.
