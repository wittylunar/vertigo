ch6-irk#3: Diamond Factory

Pozzi walked further across the desert, digesting what had happened. The phone in his pocket suddenly shook, hummed and spoke in an old man's voice, crumbling:

— CALLING... ALL. XX... AUTOBO.... OF...

— What? — Pozzi took out the phone, but it was already cracked. The casing crumbled, buttons fell out, and in a second only a handful of rusty dust remained in his hand, which immediately leaked through his fingers.

— Autobots? — Pozzi asked the emptiness. — What autobots? There were optimuses, red ones. Maybe they called reinforcements?

No one answered. Only the wind whistled over the dunes.

Pozzi shrugged and walked on. He walked for a long time, an hour or two, until suddenly he bumped his forehead into something invisible.

— Ow! — he rubbed his bruised spot and held out his hand. Right in front of him was a wall. Absolutely transparent, but solid as glass. Pozzi knocked — dull.

And at that moment the wall silently parted, opening a passage. A building was visible behind it. Another factory, but completely unlike the previous rusty one. This one shone.

Pozzi went inside, and the passage closed behind him, again becoming an invisible wall.

— Well I'll be, — he mumbled, looking around.

Everything inside was made of diamonds. Literally. Walls, floor, ceiling, machines, conveyors — everything sparkled and shimmered, reflecting light with thousands of facets. Signs hung on the walls: "67 proof".

— Holy shit, — Pozzi exhaled. — Diamond factory. And 67 proof. My number.

He walked further. Phones lay on the conveyors. Same Samsungs as last time, but new, shiny, in cyberpunk 2037 design — with neon inserts, holographic screens and "LIMITED EDITION: CYBERBOMBOCLAT" inscriptions.

Pozzi took one, turned it over. The phone turned on, showed a screensaver with flying robots and turned off.

— They work, — Pozzi was surprised. — Imagine that.

He put the phone in his pocket and walked further. A person sat at a diamond table in the very center of the hall. Bald, with a stern face, in a bloody shirt. A bottle of whiskey and a glass stood before him. The man looked straight at Pozzi.

— Hello, — he said in a hoarse voice. — Long time no see.

— Do we know each other? — Pozzi became alert.

— I'm Dexter Morgan, — the man answered, pouring himself whiskey. — And I died 560 years ago. Skibidi toilets wiped me to dust.

— What? — Pozzi's eyes bulged. — What toilets? You're from a TV series!

— What TV series? — Dexter looked at him tiredly. — I was a real person. Worked in Miami police, cut bad guys at night. And then they came. Wheeled toilets. With cameras instead of tanks. They sang their stupid songs and shot lasers. I got sucked into a toilet and ground into dust. And now I'm here.

— In a diamond factory?

— In diamond heaven for killers, — Dexter corrected. — Those who went through hell and came back gather here. You, I see, are one of us too.

Pozzi didn't know what to think. Skibidi toilets? Dexter Morgan who survived them? This was even crazier than furries or red optimuses.

— Listen, — he said. — I don't understand what's happening here at all. I'm just looking for a casino.

— Casino? — Dexter smirked. — Here, in Iraq? Yeah right. Although... they say there's an underground one in Baghdad. Only you can't get there now — it's a combat zone. Skeletons, autobots, skibidi toilets — all fighting for oil.

— Skibidi toilets fight for oil? — Pozzi asked.

— What did you think, where do they get diesel fuel from? — Dexter finished his whiskey and got up. — Well, goodbye, killer. Good luck with your quest.

He turned and disappeared into the diamond corridor.

Pozzi remained alone, with a new phone in his pocket, with a notebook where 1620 burned, and with complete misunderstanding of what was happening.

— Well, crap, — he sighed and went to look for an exit.
