ch0-tt#8: Meteor Shower

Pozzi froze on the 500th floor because right in front of him, on an old ammo crate, lay a radio. Old, worn, with a cracked screen, but sounds came from it. Through static and crackling a voice broke through:

— Poz... Repor..... Helic.... 1st fl... rea....

Pozzi tilted his head. Interference grew stronger, the voice disappeared then reappeared:

— ...Over! Pozzi, can you hear me? Helicopter on the first... floor... ready for departure... to Las Vegas...

— WHAT?! — Pozzi shouted, grabbing the radio. — Helicopter? On the first floor? Hello! Talk!

But the radio only hissed in response and fell silent. Forever.

Pozzi shook it, knocked on it, blew into the speaker—zero reaction. Dead.

— Damn it, — he exhaled. — First floor. Means I've got 499 more floors down. But there's a helicopter there. Real. To Las Vegas!

He stuffed the radio in his pocket (just in case it comes back to life) and sprinted downward at triple speed. Now he had a goal. Specific. Real. A helicopter on the first floor.

The staircase flashed before his eyes. 499... 498... 497...

Pozzi flew downward, jumping over five steps at a time. Nothing changed around him—gray walls, dim light bulbs, floor number signs. On 490 someone's sock lay. On 485 a furry ran by, but Pozzi didn't even stop—no time, helicopter's waiting! The furry watched him go with a surprised look and disappeared into the darkness.

On floor 480 the staircase unexpectedly ended at a brick wall.

— What? — Pozzi braked. The wall was real, red brick, fresh mortar. — What does this mean?

He knocked—hollow. Pushed—the wall didn't budge. Then Pozzi ran and rammed it with his shoulder. Bricks crunched pitifully but held.

— Oh, damn, — he was disappointed. — Have to find a detour.

He returned to the staircase and discovered that right around the turn was a door. A regular iron door with a sign "EMERGENCY EXIT TO 479." Pozzi pushed—open.

He flew into some corridor, ran through it, emerged onto another staircase and continued down. 479... 478...

On floor 478 he flew out onto an open landing and froze.

A TYRANNOSAURUS stood before him. Real. Huge. With teeth the size of his hand. It chewed something resembling remains of a furry costume and looked at Pozzi with small angry eyes.

— What the hell? — Pozzi blurted out.

The T-rex heard. It stopped chewing, turned its head, opened its jaws and roared so loud Pozzi's ears popped:

— RRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAH!

And it ran. In huge leaps, shaking the floor, it charged straight at Pozzi.

— Oh damn! — Pozzi shouted. — I'm late for the casino!

But there was nowhere to run. The T-rex blocked the exit, and behind was only a wall.

And then Pozzi felt it. Somewhere deep inside, in the very center of his being, a spark ignited. The very one that turned on prime mode. But now this was something else. Something greater.

He raised his hand to the sky (or rather, the ceiling, but it didn't matter) and squeezed his eyes shut.

— METEOR! — he shouted at the top of his lungs.

And a miracle happened.

The ceiling above the tyrannosaurus opened up. From somewhere above, breaking through 478 floors of concrete and steel, flew a huge blazing meteor. It was the size of a small car and headed straight for the dinosaur.

The T-rex raised its head, saw the flying fireball and froze. Surprise reflected in its small eyes.

— Take that, prehistoric! — Pozzi cried.

The meteor hit the tyrannosaurus. A deafening crash erupted, a flash, smoke. When the smoke cleared, a charred carcass lay where the dinosaur had been, and meteor fragments burned nearby.

Pozzi approached closer. The T-rex twitched a leg and went still.

— Well, why did you have to bother? — Pozzi sighed. — I was just running past.

He took out his notebook. 1523. Added:

+1 = 1524

— A dinosaur, — he pondered. — Does this even count? Furries are one thing, but an ancient lizard... Fine, let it be. Still alive.

He put away the notebook and ran further. 477... 476...

On floor 476 he stopped sharply. Because he saw IT.
