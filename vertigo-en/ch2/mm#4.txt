ch2-mm#4: Stair Landing

Pozzi lay on the bed, listening to the ocean noise and calculator clicks from the living room. Seemed like everything was normal. Home, peace, quiet. But something didn't let him relax. This Jeff... too smiley. Too attentively counting.

— Fine, — Pozzi decided. — I'll go check what he's doing.

He got up, walked into the living room. Jeff sat in the same place, nose in his calculator. Numbers glowed on the screen: 1527 and next to it 99.9%.

— What are you counting? — Pozzi asked suspiciously.

— Oh, — Jeff raised his head, smiled even wider. — Counting how much you have left.

— What do you mean—left? — Pozzi didn't understand.

— Well, to a million. 8473 more furries, and it'll be a million! — Jeff giggled. — And then a new goal. Two million. Three. Infinity.

Pozzi looked at him, at the calculator, at that endless smile, and suddenly understood: something's wrong. Completely wrong.

— Listen, Jeff, — he said slowly. — Do you even exist?

Jeff froze. The smile slid off his face.

— What do you mean?

— I mean, — Pozzi stepped closer. — I didn't call you. You appeared yourself. And counting some percentages. Who are you?

Jeff jumped up, knocking over the chair. His eyes widened, face distorted:

— I'm your friend! I help! I count!

— Friends don't smile like that, — Pozzi snapped and snapped his neck in one motion.

Jeff collapsed to the floor, went still. But instead of blood, numbers poured out of him—small, like ants. They ran across the floor, up the walls, filling the room.

And then the light flickered.

Once—went out. Twice—lit up, but dimly, yellowly. Doors slammed shut on their own with a crash. Curtains drew, cutting off sunlight.

Pozzi lunged for the exit, tugged the handle—locked. Then he ran to the window, pulled back the curtain...

And froze.

Where palm trees, ocean, and Miami sun should have been, now was a stair landing. Endless, going down, with dim light bulbs on walls. Gray concrete, rusty railings, smell of dampness.

— Oh damn, — Pozzi exhaled. — Again?

He turned around. The living room disappeared. Instead was the same staircase—above and below. The house melted like a dream. Only infinity remained.

Pozzi took out his notebook, found number 1527. Next to it someone had added:

+1 (Jeff) = 1528

— Wrote itself, — he smirked. — Well, thanks.

He put away the notebook, looked up, then down. No choice.

— Fine, — he sighed and began descending. — Somewhere here there should be a casino. Or furries. Or some other crap again.

Footsteps faded into the darkness, and the staircase went lower, into infinity from which you can't escape.

(To be continued...)
