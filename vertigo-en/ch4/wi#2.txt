ch4-wi#2: Rap Reinforcement

Pozzi flew down the stairs, pressing the GTA 67 box to his chest. Shots thundered behind — gentleman skeletons fired AK-47s, not sparing cartridges. Bullets clicked on the steps, knocked crumbs out of walls.

— How many of you are there?! — Pozzi screamed, jumping over flights.

On one of the floors the door suddenly swung open, and a hand reached out from there. It grabbed Pozzi by the scruff and yanked him inside.

— Come in, quickly!

Pozzi tumbled into the room, the door slammed, and the bolt clanked. Skeletons thundered outside, knocked with rifle butts.

— You? — Pozzi gasped, looking at his rescuer.

MORGENSTERN stood before him. The same one Pozzi had once thrown out of the helicopter. But this one looked different — fresher, meaner, and those same 10 guns hung from his pants, all of them.

— You died, — Pozzi said.

— I'm different, — MORGENSTERN grinned. — Clone. The original, the first one, you killed. And I'm a backup copy. Number 2.0.

— And you're saving me?

— Why not? — MORGENSTERN cocked two guns at once. — Skeletons here, dude. Enemies of my enemies are my friends. For now.

He flung open the door and opened fire. Ten barrels worked as a single organism — tra-ta-ta-ta-ta! Skeletons in top hats fell, scattering bones.

— Close it! — MORGENSTERN shouted, and Pozzi slammed the door, locking the bolt.

The room was dark and dusty. Some boxes, old posters. And suddenly another figure emerged from the darkness.

— Yo, — a low voice said. — There's a party here, and nobody invited me?

A guy in a black hoodie with the hood up stepped out of the shadows, a cheeky grin on his face. "FACE" was written in red on his chest.

— Oh, — MORGENSTERN said. — Where are you from?

— Walking by, — FACE answered. — Hear shooting. Think, I'll drop in, help out. Especially these skeletons... they're from the West, right? And I drop the West.

He winked and suddenly his eyes glowed red. Just like Pozzi's in prime mode.

— Lasers too? — Pozzi was surprised.

— You bet! — FACE grinned. — I can do a lot. Watch.

He opened the door slightly, leaned out into the doorway, and two blinding beams shot from his eyes. Skeletons that were already preparing to break down the door flared up and crumbled to dust.

— Eshkere! — FACE screamed. — Take that, Westerners!

— Cool, — Pozzi acknowledged. — But that's my thing.

— Now it's our common thing, — FACE answered, returning to the room. — So here's the deal, guys. Lots of skeletons out there. Need to get out while they haven't pulled up reinforcements.

— Got a plan? — MORGENSTERN asked.

— Got one, — Pozzi showed the GTA 67 box. — I won this at the casino. Seems like some kind of key or bug here. If we open it, maybe we'll break through.

— Give it here, — FACE took the box, turned it over. — There's a disc here. Old, for a console. Need to find the console.

— Console? — MORGENSTERN asked.

— Yeah. Somewhere in this building. Let's go look.

They opened the door slightly — the corridor was empty. Skeletons had temporarily retreated, but footsteps and clanking were heard somewhere below.

— Let's run up, — Pozzi decided. — The higher, the farther from them.

— Wait, — MORGENSTERN pulled some device out of his pocket. — I set up a scanner here. Strong signal on the 67th floor. Maybe the console is there?

— 67 is my number, — Pozzi grinned. — Let's go.

They ran out onto the stairs and dashed up. Shots thundered from below again — skeletons renewed the chase.

— I drop the West! — FACE screamed while running, shooting lasers downward. — I drop the West!

— Shut up and run! — MORGENSTERN shouted.

And Pozzi just smiled. With partners like these, even danger wasn't scary.
