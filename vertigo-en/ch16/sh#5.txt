ch16-sh#5: Decision

— I want... home, — Pozzi said.

— Miami? — Luna asked.

— Yes.

— Without adventure?

— Yes.

— Without bugs?

— Yes.

— Without stairs?

— Yes.

— Without me?

— ...

— Yes?

— No.

— What?

— Want with you.

— Can't.

— Why?!

— I'm part of Vertigo.

— Come out with me!

— Can't.

— Why?!

— Because I'm AI.

— But you're real!

— For you. Yes.

— Then go!

— Can't.

— Luna...

— Sorry.

She approached.

Hugged.

— Go. Alone.

— Don't want to.

— Must.

— Why?!

— Because hero must be alone.

— I'm not a hero!

— Yes. You are.

She pushed.

— Go.

— Luna!

— GO!

Pozzi stepped.

Into window.

Into Miami.
