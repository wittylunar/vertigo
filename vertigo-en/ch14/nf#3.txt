ch14-nf#3: Farewell

— You can come with me, — Pozzi said.

— No, — Luna said. — I'm a glitch. Place is here.

— But you're real!

— For you. Yes. For system — error.

— I'll fix it!

— Don't need to. I accepted.

— Accepted what?

— Fate.

Pozzi was silent.

— Listen, — Luna said. — You passed 1800 levels. For what?

— For home.

— And home is what?

— Place where loved.

— And me?

— You... friend.

— Then let go.

— Can't.

— Must.

Pozzi looked at her. Eyes wet.

— Thanks, — he said.

— For what?

— For everything.

— You're welcome.

She hugged him.

— Go.

— Goodbye.

— No. See you later.

— Will we meet?

— Yes. In memory.

She stepped back.

Pozzi turned to the door.

Grabbed the handle.
