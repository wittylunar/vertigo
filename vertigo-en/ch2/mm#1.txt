ch2-mm#1: Saratov Captivity

Pozzi was falling. Not just falling asleep, but actually falling—through the helicopter seat, through the floor, through darkness, through reality. The world around blurred, textures changed, colors faded, and suddenly...

BOOM!

He fell onto something hard and cold. Opened his eyes. This wasn't Miami. This wasn't even Las Vegas. This was a place where the sky was murky-white, grass unnaturally green, and houses stood empty, with windows taped with film.

— Where am I? — Pozzi got up, brushing off his plaid shirt.

A sign on the pole read: "SARATOV. WELCOME TO THE DREAM YOU CAN'T ESCAPE"

— What? — Pozzi didn't understand. — Saratov? I've never been here. And why can't I escape?

He looked around. The city was strange. Empty streets, frozen swings, a shop with "MILK" on the window, but inside—darkness. And silence. Viscous, cottony, unnatural.

Pozzi took a step, and suddenly silence exploded with howling.

A pack flew out from around the corner. Furries. Many of them. Dozens. With glowing eyes, foam at their mouths, muzzles distorted by mutation. They rushed straight at him.

— Again? — Pozzi sighed, preparing to shoot. — How many times...

But just then HE emerged from the alley.

A polar bear. Huge, about two and a half meters tall, with red eyes and mechanical claws. He raised his muzzle to the sky and roared so loud windows in the houses shook.

Hearing the roar, the furries went even more berserk and accelerated.

— Oh damn, — Pozzi exhaled, taking out his notebook. — Back into battle again. And where's my helicopter? Where's the dispatcher?

He looked at the empty white sky. No helicopter, no salvation. Only furries, a bear, and this damn Saratov you can't escape from.

— Fine, — Pozzi slammed his notebook shut. — If you can't escape, then you have to kill them all.

His eyes glowed red. He charged toward the pack, and the battle began.
