ch11-vs#4: Garden

Level 700 turned out to be a garden. Flowers, trees, birds singing.

— After wasteland — paradise, — Pozzi was surprised.

— Balance, — Luna said. — After death — life.

They walked on the path. Survivors walked behind, silent.

A fountain ahead. People around it. White clothes, calm faces.

— Who are they? — Pozzi whispered.

— Those who passed.

— Passed what?

— Vertigo test.

One of them approached.

— Greetings. I'm the First.

— Pozzi. We need to go further.

— I know. But rest first.

— No time.

— Time is always here.

Man gave an apple.

— Eat. You'll remember.

Pozzi ate. Flashes: Miami, beach, friends, laughter...

— This is my memory?

— Part of it. You'll find the rest.

— Where?

— At 1800th.

— Far.

— Closer than you think.
