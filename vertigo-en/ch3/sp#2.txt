ch3-sp#2: Concrete Wall

Pozzi exited the locker room, wiping sweat from his forehead. Gun smoked, ten new entries were added to the notebook, and mood slightly improved. Furries in sportswear turned out not so difficult—main thing is shoot first.

— Done, — he said to Dispatcher. — We can go.

Dispatcher peeled off the wall where he'd hidden during the shootout, and they headed for the gym exit. But they didn't even make ten steps when both froze.

A child sat on a bench by the wall.

Small, seven or eight years old, in a dirty t-shirt and torn pants. He was so grimy he looked like he hadn't washed for several months. Snot ran from his nose, saliva from his mouth, but he didn't notice. He sat, nose in an old smartphone with a cracked screen, and swiped his finger across the glass without looking away.

— Hey, — Pozzi called. — What are you sitting here for?

The child didn't even raise his head. Only saliva dripped onto his knee, and he mechanically wiped it with his sleeve, continuing to stare at the screen.

— Hello, kid! — Pozzi said louder. — Furries are running around, a helicopter crashed, and you're playing games?

Zero reaction. Some pictures flashed on the screen, beeps and melodies sounded. The child was completely immersed in his own world.

— Strange one, — Dispatcher whispered. — Maybe sick?

— Not sick, contagious, judging by appearance, — Pozzi snorted. — Fine, let him sit. Not a furry—and fine.

He was already about to go further when he noticed something strange in the wall. Next to the bench was an opening. A door opening, bricked up with concrete. Fresh, gray, without a single crack. Just like on those floors in vertigo.

— Oh, — Pozzi said. — Familiar picture.

— What? — Dispatcher didn't understand.

— There's a staircase there, — Pozzi said confidently. — I've seen walls like this before. There's always a staircase behind them.

— How do you know?

— Intuition.

Pozzi approached the wall, knocked. Hollow. Then he stepped back a couple of steps, ran, and rammed the concrete with his shoulder.

The concrete didn't even tremble.

— Ow, — Pozzi rubbed his shoulder. — Tough, damn it.

— Maybe we shouldn't? — Dispatcher timidly suggested. — Let's exit normally, through the door...

— No, — Pozzi cut off. — I know these staircases. They lead where you need to go. And regular doors—who knows where.

He looked around for a tool. Gaze fell on wall bars at the entrance. Pozzi approached, unscrewed one of the metal crossbars (thanks to pills, strength was enough), and returned to the wall.

— Now we'll...

He hit the concrete with the crossbar with force. Once, twice, three times. Concrete cracked. Another hit—and a piece of wall fell out, opening a dark opening.

Familiar smell of dampness and mold wafted from there. And yes, there was a staircase. Endless, going down, with dim light bulbs on walls.

— Told you, — Pozzi said satisfactorily, throwing away the crossbar.

Dispatcher peeked inside and shivered:

— Where does it lead?

— No idea, — Pozzi shrugged. — But it's better than waiting for them to arrest us for violating airspace.

He turned to the child. The child still sat, nose in the phone, and didn't even look at the crash.

— Good luck staying, kid, — Pozzi waved his hand. — Don't drip saliva on the floor.

The child didn't answer.

Pozzi stepped into the opening. Dispatcher, after hesitating, followed him.

The staircase met them with silence and cold. Water dripped somewhere far below.

— Here we go again, — Pozzi sighed, beginning his descent. — How many times?

— Where are we going? — Dispatcher asked.

— Don't know, — Pozzi honestly answered. — But somewhere there's a casino. Or furries. Or both. Or maybe just an exit.

They descended lower, and light from the opening in the gym faded behind them until it disappeared completely.

Pozzi's notebook had 1538 (1528 + 10 furries from the locker room). He put a plus sign and put away the notebook.

— Interesting, — he said into the darkness, — does this child even exist? Or did he also appear in a dream?

— Don't know, — Dispatcher answered. — I don't know anything anymore.

Footsteps faded into the staircase depths, and in the gym a grimy boy remained sitting, nose in the phone. He never raised his head, even when shadows behind him began crawling out of the crashed helicopter.
