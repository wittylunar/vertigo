ch1-cs#5: Lost Connection

Pozzi stepped over the threshold of the 199th floor and immediately saw it. On an old crate, right in the middle of an empty room, lay a radio. Exactly like the two he'd found before—worn, with a cracked screen, but working.

A voice came from it. Through static and crackling, barely audible:

— Las..... Radiation ejection..... Mutant..... Isola......

Pozzi lunged for the radio, grabbed it, brought it to his ear:

— Hello! Talk! What mutant? What isolation? Over!

— ......as-Vegas..... impact zone...... class 67 mutants..... floor isolation..... stay away from......

And then the radio beeped, the screen went dark, and only a quiet rustling came from the speaker.

— Oh no! — Pozzi shouted, shaking the radio. — No! Finish! Away from what? From where?

He knocked on it, blew into the speaker, even tried to put the dead battery back in—useless. The radio was silent as a stone.

— Damn it, — Pozzi exhaled, looking at the dead device. — Connection lost again at the most interesting part.

He stood there a minute, digesting what he'd heard. "Las-Vegas"—that's clear. "Radiation ejection"—also clear, many floors here are contaminated. "Mutant"—well, he'd seen furries, Big Smoke was quite a mutant. "Floor isolation"—apparently about the concrete walls placed here.

But the main thing—"stay away from..." From what? From whom?

Pozzi looked at the radio, then at the door leading further down.

— Fine, — he decided. — If they said stay away, that's exactly where I need to go. Straight into the heart of it.

He stuffed the dead radio in his pocket (a habit of collecting already the third one), adjusted his plaid shirt, and stepped toward the staircase.

Nothing to write in the notebook—the radio doesn't count, it's not alive.

— 198th, here I come, — Pozzi said and began descending further.

New floors, new mysteries, and possibly answers to questions he hadn't even managed to ask awaited him below.
