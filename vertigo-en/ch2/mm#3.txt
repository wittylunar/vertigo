ch2-mm#3: Cheat Code

Pozzi stood surrounded by furries, and the white bear advanced, baring steel teeth. Situation couldn't be worse. Weapons—only a notebook and empty pockets. Food—eternal satiety pill that no longer helped. Allies—zero.

— Come on, — Pozzi croaked, clenching his fists. — Come on, furry. I'll give you a game.

The bear raised its paw to strike, and at that moment Pozzi remembered.

Cheat codes.

In the old game he'd played before all this nightmare, there were codes. Immortality, weapons, flight. What if it works here too?

— ROCKETMAN! — he shouted at the top of his lungs.

The world around froze. Furries froze like statues. The bear froze with raised paw. And Pozzi suddenly felt something ignite behind his back.

Two fire jets burst from his shoulder blades. Just like Iron Man, only without the suit. Pozzi lifted off the ground, shot upward, bursting through clouds with his head.

— Yes! — he roared with delight. — IT WORKS!

Below, Saratov, furries, the bear—everything shrank to a dot. Pozzi flew through the white sky, through dreams, through reality, and suddenly...

— Hey, wake up! — someone shook him by the shoulder.

Pozzi opened his eyes. He was sitting in a helicopter seat. Palm trees and ocean floated by outside the window. The dispatcher looked at him with bewilderment.

— Why are you screaming? Some "Rocketman"? Dreamt it, right?

— Huh? — Pozzi rubbed his eyes. — Where are we?

— Five minutes to Miami, — the pilot answered. — Slept the whole way. Heading home.

The helicopter softly touched down on the platform next to a small seaside house. Pozzi climbed out, staggering, said goodbye to the dispatcher, and trudged toward the door.

— Finally home, — he mumbled, inserting the key into the lock.

The door opened. Pozzi stepped inside and froze.

In the living room, at the table, someone sat. Not a furry, not a monster, but a regular person in glasses and a strange smile. He diligently poked a calculator, calculating something.

— Who are you? — Pozzi tensed.

The person raised his head, smiled even wider, and continued pressing buttons.

Pozzi approached closer, looked over his shoulder. Numbers glowed on the calculator: 1527, then 1528, then some percentages.

— What the hell is this didiblad doing on a calculator? — Pozzi wondered aloud. — Is he Epstein?

The person suddenly giggled and answered in a thin voice:

— I'm counting how many furries you killed. And calculating percentages. You almost reached a million!

— What? — Pozzi snatched the calculator. — Who are you anyway?

— I'm your accountant, — the stranger grinned. — They hired me to keep score. Name's Jeffrey. Just Jeff.

Pozzi looked at him, at the calculator, at number 1527, then back at Jeff.

— Listen, Jeff, — he said slowly. — Did you escape from that island or what?

Jeff laughed:

— No, I just love counting. And helping heroes like you. Your statistics are impressive. Want me to keep accounting further?

Pozzi thought for a second, then shrugged:

— Fine, sit. But if I find out you organized some underground casino with kids—I'll personally throw you out the window. Got it?

— Got it, got it, — Jeff nodded and returned to his calculator.

Pozzi sighed, walked into the bedroom, and collapsed onto the bed. Ocean rustled outside the window, seagulls cried somewhere, and a strange accountant clicked buttons in the living room.

— Home, sweet home, — Pozzi whispered and fell into sleep.

This time without adventures.
