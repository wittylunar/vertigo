ch2-mm#2: Saratov Escape

Pozzi sprinted from the spot like an Olympian. Legs carried him forward, and in his hands was that very MORGENSTERN gun—one of ten that miraculously survived all the troubles. He turned while running and pressed the trigger.

RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!

The burst pierced the first furries. They squealed, rolled across the asphalt, but the rest didn't even slow down. They climbed over corpses, jumped over the wounded, and rushed on, eyes gleaming.

— Why are you so damn resilient! — Pozzi shouted, changing magazines on the run.

The white bear wasn't running. He was walking. Slowly, heavily, but each step shook the earth. He clearly knew Pozzi had nowhere to go.

Pozzi turned into an alley, jumped over a fence, ran through someone's vegetable garden, and flew out onto the next street. The furries didn't fall behind. They climbed fences faster than cats, jumped from roofs, crawled out of basements. There were more and more of them.

— How many of you are there?! — Pozzi shot without aiming, just into the crowd.

Bullets ran out. He threw away the gun and ran faster. Eternal satiety pills and molecule multiplier worked—strength held out, but there were too many furries.

The city outskirts appeared ahead. Houses grew sparse, fields stretched instead, and a highway was visible in the distance. Freedom?

Pozzi ran out of the city. One step, second, third... he already thought he'd escaped when suddenly the world around jerked, blurred, and within a second he was standing in the center of Saratov again. Same place where he'd fallen. Opposite stood the white bear, looking at him with red eyes.

— What?! — Pozzi shouted. — How?

He ran again. Again the outskirts. Again a jump beyond the city limits. And again—jerk!—teleportation back to the same street.

— CAN'T ESCAPE, — the bear droned in a low voice. — NO ONE CAN ESCAPE.

Pozzi breathed heavily, hands on knees. Furries surrounded him in a tight ring, but didn't attack. Waited for the command.

— So what now? — Pozzi asked the bear. — You gonna eat me?

— NO, — the bear answered. — YOU WILL PLAY.

— Play what? — Pozzi didn't understand.

The bear bared its teeth, and steel teeth gleamed in its maw:

— THE GAME. BY THE RULES. THIS IS DREAMCORE. YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO PLAY HERE.

Pozzi straightened up, took out his notebook, looked at number 1527, then at the furries, then at the bear.

— Play, huh, — he smirked. — Fine. I like games. Just remember: I always win.

The bear growled—either threateningly, or contentedly.

And Pozzi was already opening his notebook to a new page, ready to record the score.
