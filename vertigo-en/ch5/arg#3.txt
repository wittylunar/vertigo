ch5-arg#3: Abandoned House

Pozzi ran without seeing the road. Legs sank in snow, lungs tore from frosty air, but immortality pills and molecule multiplier drove him forward. Red igloo lights and a horde of hypnotized penguins remained somewhere far behind.

— 67 kilometers, — he counted to himself, jumping over ice hummocks. — 67, 67, 67...

Finally something dark appeared ahead against the white plain. A house. Old, abandoned, with a collapsed roof and broken windows. But for Pozzi now it was a real palace.

He flew inside, slammed the door and leaned his back against it, breathing heavily. It smelled of mold and dampness in the house, but there was at least some shelter.

— Phew, — he exhaled, sliding down the wall to the floor.

After resting for a minute, Pozzi got up and began to look around. The house was small: one room with a stove, table, couple of chairs, a cot in the corner. Windows boarded up with boards, but some boards had rotted somewhere. Pozzi found a rusty hammer and several nails in the corner, nailed up what he could, propped the door with a heavy dresser.

— Now it looks like a fortress, — he said contentedly.

Several days passed. Pozzi lived in this house, going out only when necessary and to get snow for water. Penguins didn't appear, uwogylu neither. Only the northern lights shimmered in the sky every night — green, purple, sometimes red.

— Beautiful, — Pozzi sighed, looking through the gap between the boards. — Like a sanatorium, damn. Only skeletons are missing for complete happiness.

And at that moment the sky exploded.

A red beam shot up from the horizon, pierced the northern lights and pointed straight at the sky. A portal opened where it touched the clouds. A huge black hole, framed by crimson flashes.

— Holy shit, — Pozzi only managed to say.

Points poured out of the portal. They fell down, approaching, and soon became distinguishable. Skeletons. Familiar skeletons in Red Army uniform, in officer caps, with cigars in their teeth. Each held a machine gun in their hands, and not just any, but a real AK-47.

— God damn it! — Pozzi screamed. — Again?!

Skeletons fell into the snow, got up, brushed themselves off and formed up. Pozzi counted about five hundred. They moved in unison, like on parade, and were clearly heading toward his house.

— How did they find out? — Pozzi groaned, grabbing his head.

The answer came by itself. A huge red hologram appeared in the sky, against the portal background. uwogylu's face grinned with all its mouth.

— Missed me, Pozzi? — the voice spread over the plain. — I decided to diversify your leisure. Here are 500 skeletons from the "May 9" casino for you. Have fun.

— WHY?! — Pozzi screamed at the sky.

— Because you're an interesting bug. Want to see how you'll cope.

Pozzi cursed, took out the notebook, quickly calculated his resources. Few cartridges, no grenades, only an empty machine gun, a hammer and a GTA 67 box that still lay in his pocket.

— Okay, — he said to himself. — It's been worse.

Skeletons were already approaching the house, deploying in a chain. Their caps and cigars looked eerie in the northern lights.

Pozzi sighed, cocked the bolt (empty, but for intimidation) and prepared for battle.

— Come on, your bony asses, — he whispered. — I'm Pozzi. I'm a furry-killer. And you're not even furries. But today you'll be in the notebook.

Skeletons opened fire.
