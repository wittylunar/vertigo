ch14-nf#4: Door

Pozzi opened the door.

Light behind. Bright, warm, real.

He stepped.

And felt.

Sand. Warm, under feet.

Wind. Salty, from ocean.

Sun. Bright, overhead.

— Miami...

He opened his eyes.

Beach. Palms. Ocean. People laughing.

— Home...

He fell to his knees. Sand real.

— Home!

He laughed. Cried. Screamed.

People watched. Didn't understand.

He didn't care.

— Home!

He ran to the water.

Dived.

Cold! Real!

— I'm home!

He came out. Lay on sand.

Sun warmed.

Everything over.

— Or not?

He sat up.

Notebook in pocket.

Took it out.
