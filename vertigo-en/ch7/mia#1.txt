ch7-mia#1: Return to Miami

Pozzi drove down the desert highway on the hijacked car, turning the music up full. Wind whistled in the open windows, sand flew from under the wheels, and he just smiled, feeling freedom.

— Baghdad, you say? — he shouted into the emptiness. — Screw Baghdad! There's probably more skeletons, toilets or these autobots of yours there. I'll go home!

He turned the steering wheel, and the car veered to the side, leaving the highway for some dirt road. The map in the glove compartment showed that if you cut across the desert, you could reach the coast directly, and there — a boat, a plane, and there it is, Miami.

Pozzi didn't notice how he passed the turn to Baghdad. And rightly so — nothing to do there. Stories that could happen in the next 24 chapters just didn't happen. They dissolved in the sand, like a mirage.

After several hours of crazy driving the car ran out of steam, and Pozzi crossed the ocean on a container ship that happened by. Another day — and he's in Miami.

Sun, palm trees, ocean, beautiful people on the embankment. Pozzi got out of the taxi at his house, inhaled the salty air and almost teared up.

— Finally home, — he exhaled.

He opened the door with a key (the key miraculously survived in his pocket) and went inside. It was quiet in the house, smelled of dust and desolation. Pozzi went into the room and saw his computer. A thick layer of dust covered the monitor, processor and video card.

— Haven't been here in a while, — he sighed, wiping dust with his hand. — A month? A year? A century?

He turned on the computer — it hummed, loading. The mobile phone he left at home was also dead — airplane mode, discharged to zero.

— Okay, later.

Pozzi approached the window, looked out on the street. Sun, palm trees, people in shorts. And suddenly a stack of diamonds fell out of his pocket — the very ones he grabbed at the factory in Iraq.

— Oh, — he was surprised. — Where did these come from?

Strange sandals were on his feet, which he also didn't remember where he got. Made of netherite, like in Minecraft.

— Seems I mined something there too, — Pozzi grinned.

An engine sound came from the street. He looked out — a Porsche Cabriolet stood under the windows, bright red, with the top down. Some guy in dark sunglasses sat behind the wheel and waved at him.

— Hey, Pozzi! — the guy shouted. — What are you stuck there for? Let's go to the beach!

Pozzi recognized him. It was his old friend, with whom he partied before all these crazy adventures. Alive, real, not a furry, not a skeleton.

— Coming! — Pozzi screamed and ran out of the house.

He jumped into the car, they took off along the embankment, wind tousled their hair, music played in the speakers:

— Where will you be resting this summer, buddy? Rolling under palm trees in Miami!

Pozzi leaned back in the seat, closed his eyes and smiled.

— Finally, — he whispered. — Rest.

At the beach they took surfboards and went into the water. Waves were great, Pozzi rode one, second, third. He felt like Aquaman, flew into tubes, flew out, screamed with delight.

— Wee! — he screamed, riding a wave.

This wasn't Bali, not Malibu, but life was like a movie — real Hollywood. Pozzi went ashore, collapsed on the hot sand and ordered a cola from a passing vendor.

— How are you? — the vendor asked.

— How are things? Great! — Pozzi answered.

He put the car in the shade and went to sunbathe. The sun warmly warmed, the ocean rustled, and the notebook with number 1621 lay in the pocket and slept peacefully.

— Tomorrow, — Pozzi decided. — Tomorrow adventures will begin again. But today — rest.

He closed his eyes and fell into sleep. Without skeletons, without furries, without danger. Just a sleep under Miami palms.



The End.
