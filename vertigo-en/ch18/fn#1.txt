ch18-fn#1: Finale. Part 1 — Return

Pozzi woke up in the morning.

Sun shone.

Birds sang.

He got up.

Went to window.

Miami.

Palms.

Ocean.

— Home, — he said.

Took the notebook.

Last time.

Opened.

1800 / 2000

— Enough, — he said.

Closed.

Put in drawer.

Forever.

Got dressed.

Went out.

Friends outside.

— Let's go to the beach!

— Let's go, — he said.

They walked.

Laughed.

Talked.

— How's life?

— Good.

— Really?

— Yes.

— Glad.

— Me too.

Came to beach.

Sand warm.

Water blue.

Sky clear.

— Without bugs, — Pozzi said.

— What? — friend asked.

— Nothing.

Smiled.

Undressed.

Went into water.

Cold!

— Real! — he screamed.

— What's real?!

— Everything!

Came out.

Lay on sand.

Sun warmed.

— Home, — he said.

Closed eyes.

Smiled.
