ch9-dm#1: Dream Dimension

Pozzi climbed, counting steps. 66, 67, 68... But the higher he went, the stranger it became.

Walls pulsed. Lamps flashed in heart rhythm. Whisper from speakers — thousands of voices.

— Where am I?

Sign: "LEVEL 200 — DREAM DIMENSION".

— Dream? Again?

The staircase disappeared. He fell. Miami, Arctic, Iraq, furries, skeletons — everything mixed.

Fell on something soft. Opened eyes — his room in Miami. Computer, posters, bed.

— Home?

Phone rang. Black, wired.

— Hello?

— Wake up. You're sleeping.

— Who's this?

— I'm the one who created you.

Room disappeared, turning into code lines. Python, C++, Java — all mixed.

— NO! I'M REAL!

— Reality is relative. But you have a chance. Prove you exist.

— How?!

— Kill me.

A figure appeared from the code. A person at a computer, back turned, typing.

Pozzi pulled out his gun — it turned into a keyboard.

— Kill. Type. Create.

Pozzi started typing.
