ch13-tm#2: Choice

— Who won't make it? — Pozzi repeated.

— Don't know, — Luna said. — Future changes.

— From what?

— From choice.

— Mine?

— Yes. Every step changes the future.

— Then show more.

Pozzi turned the handle. Screen flickered.

New future: him with Luna, together on the beach.

— This is... us?

— Yes. If you go together.

— And if alone?

Screen showed: him alone, with notebook, looking at ocean.

— Is this better?

— Don't know. You decide.

— How much to 1800th?

— 400 levels.

— Will we make it?

— If you choose right.

— And which choice is right?

— The one you won't regret.

Pozzi looked at the screens. Past, future, options...

— Enough.

He turned off the machine.

— Let's go.

— Sure?

— Yes. Will choose on the way.

— Wise.

They went to the exit.

Machine hummed behind.
