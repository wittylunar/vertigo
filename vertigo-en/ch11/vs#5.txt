ch11-vs#5: Choice

— We're going with you, — one survivor said.

— No, — the First said. — This is their path.

— But we want to go home!

— Can't return home. Can only find a new home.

— Where?

— Here. In the garden.

— But...

— Think about it. Path is dangerous. Many don't make it.

Survivors looked at each other.

— We'll stay, — the woman decided.

— Wise, — the First said.

Pozzi watched.

— They could have come with us.

— But they don't want to. Freedom of choice is the main thing in Vertigo.

— Even if the choice is wrong?

— Especially then.

Pozzi nodded.

— Let's go.

— Rest first, — the First said. — Long path tomorrow.

— What path?

— 800th is mountains. High, cold, dangerous.

— We're ready, — Luna said.

— Then go now.

— Now?

— Yes. Stars will show the way at night.

They went. Garden remained behind.

Mountains loomed ahead.
