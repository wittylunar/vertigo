ch6-irk#4: Iraq Casino

Pozzi walked further across the desert, but hadn't even gone a hundred meters when he bumped into an invisible wall again.

— God damn it! — he screamed, rubbing his forehead. — How many times?!

The wall silently parted, opening a passage. Pozzi stepped inside, thinking he'd end up in the diamond factory again. But the passage closed, and he found himself... in the desert. The same one he had just left.

— Factory disappeared? — he was surprised, looking around. — And what about the second phone? I wanted to take another one!

But there was no factory. And no wall. Only sand, sun and lights in the distance.

Pozzi squinted. Lights flickered, shimmered, and familiar music came from there — the very same one that plays in all casinos of the world.

— Casino! — he rejoiced and dashed there.

In half an hour he stood at the entrance. A huge neon sign read:

IRAK CASINO
JACKPOT • ROULETTE • ALL THE WORLD

It was crowded inside. Ordinary people — Arabs, Europeans, tourists — sat at tables, pulled machine levers, drank whiskey and shouted. No skeletons, no furries. A normal, living casino.

Pozzi beamed. Finally!

He approached the first available machine, reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of tokens (where did they come from? probably from back when he played in "May 9"). Threw in a token, pulled the lever.

Ding-ding-ding — the reels spun and stopped: cherry, cherry, lemon. Loss.

— Doesn't matter, — Pozzi said and threw the next token.

He played like a madman. Threw tokens, pulled the lever, won, lost, threw again. Eyes burned, hands shook, he didn't step away from the machine for a second.

— More! — he screamed. — One more! I'll get lucky now!

An hour passed. Two. Three. Pozzi lost a bunch of money, won a bit, lost again. He turned into a zombie, obsessed with gambling.

A casino employee approached him — a huge security guard in a black suit.

— Sir, you've been here for three hours. Maybe take a rest? — he asked politely.

— Get lost! — Pozzi barked, not turning around.

The guard frowned and called for backup. Two more approached.

— Sir, you'll have to leave the establishment, — the senior one said. — You're behaving inadequately.

They grabbed Pozzi by the arms, trying to pull him away from the machine.

Pozzi jerked. Once — and one guard's head separated from his body and rolled across the floor. Didn't even understand how it happened. Just a reflex.

— A-A-A! — the remaining guards screamed, jumping back.

Visitors turned around. Saw the headless body, Pozzi with crazy eyes and rushed to the exit.

— Madman! — they screamed. — He's a killer! Run!

In five minutes the casino was empty. Only Pozzi, the guard's corpse and a frightened dealer hiding under the table remained.

Pozzi looked at his hands, then at the body, then at the machine.

— Ah, — he said. — Well, whatever. Now at least nobody bothers me.

He took out the notebook, added:

+1 (guard) = 1621

And continued playing. In an empty casino, to quiet music, in the light of flickering lights.

(To be continued...)
