ch0-tt#3: Cabbage Girls

Pozzi stood over the pile of helicopter wreckage, breathing heavily. His plaid shirt had turned to rags, brown hair matted with sweat and others' blood. But most importantly—he was still wearing the bulletproof vest. The very one he'd put on before fighting 1448 furries.

Black blood of zombie-wolves covered him in a thick layer. It dripped from his hands, ran down his chest, squelched unpleasantly with every movement.

— Ugh, Pozzi grimaced. — Sticky.

He tugged at the strap, the vest gave with difficulty—apparently dried blood acted like superglue. But Pozzi was stubborn. He pulled harder, then harder still, and finally the vest tore from his body with a sickening squelch.

And then something strange happened.

The vest began to crumble in his hands. First cracks appeared on the plates, then pieces of steel broke off, turning to dust, and within seconds nothing remained of the expensive armor but a gray pile of ash that the wind immediately blew off the roof.

— Holy crap, Pozzi whistled. — Just like in that Indiana Jones movie. Hope I don't crumble too.

He wiggled his fingers, felt his face—seemed to be holding together. So he could move on.

Pozzi headed toward the spawn. Down there, at the counter-terrorist respawn point, it was always quiet. Well, relatively quiet. If you didn't count the music blaring from there.

Even from afar he heard that sound. Some heavy industrial beat mixed with female vocals, and it all sounded like it was recorded straight in hell.

"—It's cabbage, bitch! (—to me!)"

Pozzi stopped, listened. Cabbage? He hadn't eaten cabbage since the last time he escaped from virtuality.

He cautiously peeked around the corner. At the spawn, right at the respawn mark, sat three of them. Girls. Strange girls. They were dressed in some torn clothes, with multicolored hair, and one of them held a phone from which that strange song poured.

"Bruises all over my body (I), I'm Shizuku Kuze"

— These are those... — Pozzi whispered. — Cabbage girls. I read about them on the internet. They say they're crazier than me.

"Hit me, I like it, kill me, I like it"

One of the girls, the one standing closest, noticed him. She smiled such a strange smile that a normal person would get goosebumps.

— Ooh, look, a boy! — she squeaked. — In plaid! How tasty!

"I'll hide your body (I), it's lying useless"

The second girl chimed in:

— Come to us, boy! We're singing here! It's our favorite song! About death! And brain cancer! Do you like brain cancer?

"I'm that girl with brain cancer"

Pozzi silently stared at them. There was no fear in his eyes. Not even interest. Only exhaustion and mild irritation.

— Listen, he finally said. — I just fought 1448 furries. In prime mode. Lasers shot from my eyes. I'm tired as a dog. And all I want is to find a way to get to the casino.

The girls looked at each other.

— We have a casino! — the third suddenly said. — True, it's in our head. Want to come in? There's a bone roulette!

"Let's take a photo, let's take a photo (Well)"

— No, Pozzi cut off. — I need a real casino. With chips. With blackjack. With Monroe.

— Ooh, how boring, the first girl pouted. — Maya, maybe we should hurt him?

— Let's, the second nodded. — Eva, hold him, and I'll hit.

"Hit me, I like it, kill me, I like it"

They moved toward him. Three girls with crazy eyes who had just been singing about hiding corpses.

Pozzi sighed.

— Fine. You asked for it.

He didn't even turn on prime mode. Why bother? For the likes of them, normal state was enough.

The first girl, apparently Eva, ran up to him with raised hand, clearly intending to hit. Pozzi simply grabbed her by the scruff like a kitten and threw her into the wall. She hit, groaned, and slid down.

— Ooh, that hurts... — she whispered with a smile. — How pleasant...

The second, Maya, tried to kick him. Pozzi caught her leg, pulled her toward him, and when she lost balance, lightly pushed her toward the window.

— Don't! — the third, Nika, cried. — We just wanted to play!

— That's what I'm doing, Pozzi smirked.

He approached Nika, who was backing toward the windowsill. Grabbed her arm, then with his other hand picked up the recovering Eva, with his foot scooped up Maya who was trying to stand, and in one motion threw all three through the large panoramic window.

The glass crunched pitifully and shattered into a million pieces.

The girls flew out with screams mixing fear and delight.

— We're flying! — one screamed.

— How beautiful! — echoed another.

— Mama, I'm a st-a-a-a-ar! — the third's echo drifted downward.

Pozzi looked out the window. 777 floors. Nothing visible below anymore—only fog and lights of Vegas that haunted him everywhere.

— From 777 floors, he muttered. — Beautiful number. Like in a casino.

He stood there another second, looking down, then took out his notebook. Found the page with number 1515. Added at the bottom:

+3 = 1518

— Cabbage girls, he snorted. — Didn't even listen. Got tired of their music.

Wind blew through the broken window, rustling his brown hair, already back to normal. Somewhere far below, three bodies had probably already smashed, but Pozzi didn't think about that. He thought about the casino.

— How do I get there? — he asked the void.

The void didn't answer. Only somewhere in the background, in the speaker of one of the girls' broken phones, the song still quietly played:

"But luckily, you're already dead..."

Pozzi kicked the phone with his foot, and it flew out the window after its owners.

— Exactly, he said. — Luckily.

And he moved on. Ahead was another whole floor full of enemies, adventures, and maybe, finally, some real luck.

(To be continued...)
