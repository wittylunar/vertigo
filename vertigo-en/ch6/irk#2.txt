ch6-irk#2: Dust of Ages

Pozzi dashed to the factory, but ran only about ten meters when he realized — shooting had stopped. He turned around and saw something strange.

Skeletons from the crater — those who called themselves Bomboclat Squad — fired exactly twenty bullets. Machine guns clicked one last time and froze. And then skeletons began to fall. Not from bullets, not from explosion — just from time.

— What the... — Pozzi stopped, watching this spectacle.

Bones crumbled right before his eyes. Skulls turned into dust, vertebrae disintegrated into dust, rusty helmets fell to the sand with a dull thud and also began to rust at double speed. In a minute only a pile of gray ash remained from the entire squad, which the desert wind immediately scattered.

Pozzi carefully approached closer. The crater was empty. Only that very phone lay at the bottom — Samsung Bomboclat Edition, intact and unharmed, with "100% charge" inscription on the screen.

— Holy shit, — Pozzi whistled, descending into the crater and picking up the phone. — You're alive? Or is this a glitch?

The phone suddenly spoke in a creaky voice:

— Bomboclat activated. Awaiting further instructions.

— What? — Pozzi almost dropped the tube. — You talk?

— I am Bomboclat model combat phone. My task is to summon skeleton squads to protect the owner. But these skeletons were from the 1312 production batch. Expired. That's why they crumbled.

— And now what?

— Now need to find new ones. There's a skeleton burial ground from the "May 9" casino in this area. They'll lie for another couple hundred years. Or you can go toward Baghdad — there are fresh ones, from 2023.

Pozzi thought. On one hand, having his own skeleton squad would be useful. On the other — he's actually a furry-killer, not a lord of the dead.

— Okay, — he decided. — We'll figure it out. Lie in the pocket for now.

He put the phone back, climbed out of the crater and walked further across the desert, leaving the rusty factory and remains of expired skeletons behind him.

A new entry appeared in the notebook:

+20 (suicide skeletons) = 1620
