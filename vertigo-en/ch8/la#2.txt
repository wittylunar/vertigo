ch8-la#2: Neon City

Pozzi descended to the 50th floor and entered a city. Neon signs, flying cars, holograms. Inscription in the sky: "NIGHT CITY 2077".

— Cyberpunk? Seriously?

A guy with a metal arm and "67" tattoo approached him.

— I'm Rocky. Local guide. You're new?

— Pozzi. I need to get to the 100th floor.

— 100th? Far. Need transport. But nothing's free.

— What do you need?

— Steal a chip from Arasaka corporation. 50th floor, server room.

— Why me?

— Because you're the chosen one. Luna sent you.

Pozzi thought. Nothing to lose.

— Okay. Let's go.

They got in a black flying car. Rocky hit the gas, and they rushed to the Arasaka building.

— Hold on! It's gonna be hot!

The car crashed into the wall at full speed.
