ch14-nf#1: Sky

Level 1700 — sky. Clouds, wind, flight.

— How to walk here? — Pozzi asked.

— Fly, — Luna said.

— We don't have wings.

— Have. Inner ones.

— What?

— Believe.

Pozzi didn't believe. But stepped into emptiness.

And flew.

— It works!

— Yes. Faith creates reality.

They flew over clouds. Levels flashed below.

— How much to 1800th?

— Almost there.

— Where?

— There.

Luna pointed. An island in the sky ahead. A building on it.

— Is that it?

— Yes. 1800th.

— Finale?

— No. Beginning of the end.

— What does that mean?

— You'll see.

They landed on the island.

Wind stopped.

Silence.
