ch10-oc#6: Center of Maze

They reached the center. A mirror stood there. In it — Pozzi, but with different eyes.

— This is you, — Luna said. — Real.

— How is he different?

— No scars. No notebook. No kills.

Pozzi watched.

— I want to be like that.

— Can't. Can't change the past.

— Then why show?

— So you understand. You shouldn't be like that. You should be yourself.

Mirror cracked. Light from the crack.

— Exit, — Luna said.

They walked through the light.

Ended up on the stairs. Sign: "LEVEL 500 → 600".

— How much more? — Pozzi asked.

— 1500.

— Far.

— But you're closer than you were.

— To what?

— To yourself.

Luna gave him the pearl of Atlantis.

— Keep it. Reminder that even at the bottom there's light.

Pozzi took it. Pearl was warm.

— Thanks.

— You're welcome. Let's go.

They went up. Maze remained behind.

In the notebook: 5 / 2000.
