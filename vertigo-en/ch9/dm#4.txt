ch9-dm#4: Hall of Mirrors

Pozzi exited the Library into a hall. Everything made of mirrors. Floor, ceiling, walls — reflections everywhere.

In each one, him. But different.

With lasers. With a gun. In a suit. Dead.

— What is this?

— Your alternative versions, — a voice said.

She came out of the mirror. Pozzi. But a girl. In a dress, with a notebook.

— Hi. I'm Pozzina. Your female version from a parallel world.

— Impossible...

— In Vertigo, anything is possible.

She touched the mirror. Others came out.

Pozzi-cyborg. Pozzi-skeleton. Pozzi-furry. Pozzi-author.

— We're all you, — said Pozzina. — From different worlds.

— Why?

— To warn. 400th level is a trap.

— What trap?

— There the system decides: character or human.

— And if character?

— Deletion. rm -rf pozzi/*

— And if human?

— Nobody knows. Nobody has passed.

— Why?

— Everyone gave up before.

They put their hands on his shoulders.

— But you're different. You killed the author. You're the first.

— What do I do?

— Go. Remember — you're not just a character. You write yourself.

She kissed him on the cheek. All reflections disappeared.

Only Pozzi remained. Alone. And the door to the 400th.
