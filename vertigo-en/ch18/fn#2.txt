A year passed.

Pozzi lived.

Work. Home. Friends. Love.

— You're happy? — she asked.

— Yes, — he answered.

— Really?

— Yes.

— After everything?

— Yes.

— Didn't dream about it?

— Dreamed.

— What?

— Stairs.

— Scary?

— No.

— Why?

— Because passed.

— Will you return?

— No.

— Never?

— Never.

— Promise?

— Promise.

She hugged.

— Love you, — she said.

— Me too, — he said.

Sat.

Watched sunset.

— Beautiful, — she said.

— Yes, — he said.

— Better than Vertigo?

— Yes.

— Why?

— Because real.

— Don't miss it?

— No.

— Why?

— Because adventure here.

— Which?

— Life.

She smiled.

— Right, — she said.

Sun set.

Stars came out.

They sat.

Together.

Happy.
