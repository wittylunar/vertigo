ch2-mm#5: Back in the Ladder

Pozzi walked down the staircase, trying not to think about how he ended up here again. Just now there was a house, ocean, palm trees—and here you go, a damn endless stair landing with dim lights and smell of dampness.

— Why stairs again? — he muttered, stepping over a step. — I already thought, that's it, fought my way out, retired. But no, here we go again, stairs.

He descended one flight and saw a door with a sign "76." Next to the door stood... a house. Exactly like his own in Miami. Same walls, same roof, same "WELCOME" mat at the entrance.

— Nope, — Pozzi said, not even stopping. — No thanks. Just got out of there. Had enough surprises.

He jumped over five steps at once, landed on the next landing, and ran further. Staircase flashed, numbers on signs blurred: 75, 74, 73... Pozzi flew down with acceleration that pills and anger gave him.

— I hate stairs, — he growled while running. — I hate furries. I hate this damn Saratov in dreams. I want a casino. A real one.

Numbers on signs changed: 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1.

First floor!

Pozzi flew out the door and found himself on a landing pad. Exactly like last time. And on it stood a helicopter. The very one, military, with spinning blades. And the dispatcher—the very one who pulled him out of Las Vegas—darted nearby.

— SERIK! — the dispatcher shouted, seeing Pozzi, and lunged at him.

Pozzi froze. The dispatcher ran, waving his arms, and his face looked like he'd seen a ghost. He grabbed Pozzi by the scruff and shook him:

— You! You exist?! You're real?!

— What's wrong? — Pozzi was taken aback.

— I thought you were a dream to me! — the dispatcher shouted. — I've been sitting here a week, no one around, only stairs and this hum! And then you come running out! Who are you anyway?!

Pozzi looked at him carefully. The dispatcher was pale, disheveled, with red eyes. Apparently really sat alone a long time.

— Listen, — Pozzi said slowly. — Do you yourself even exist?

The dispatcher froze. Let go of Pozzi, stepped back.

— What do you mean? — his voice trembled.

— I mean, — Pozzi took out his notebook, showed him. — See? I write down everyone I killed here. You're not here. You're not on the list. So you're either not killed, or...

— Or what? — the dispatcher turned even paler.

— Or you don't exist at all, — Pozzi finished.

The dispatcher opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. Then slowly raised his hand and felt his face.

— I... I feel real, — he whispered.

— Furries also felt real until I erased them with lasers, — Pozzi snorted. — Fine, let's get out of here. Where are we flying?

— I... don't know, — the dispatcher answered helplessly. — No map. Instruments glitch. I don't even know if there's something outside.

Pozzi approached the helicopter, looked inside. Everything worked, hummed, blinked. But only gray fog was beyond the portholes.

— So, — Pozzi decided. — We sit, take off, and fly straight. Somewhere we'll get. If we don't—we'll figure it out there.

The dispatcher nodded, climbed into the pilot's seat. Pozzi sat next to him.

The helicopter lifted off the pad and dove into the gray fog.

— By the way, — Pozzi said, taking out his notebook. — What's your name?

— Dispatcher, — he answered. — Just Dispatcher.

— Well, Dispatcher, — Pozzi added on a new page in his notebook: "Dispatcher—not yet killed, status: questionable." — If it turns out you're a furry, I'll personally throw you out the window.

— I'm not a furry, — the dispatcher said offendedly.

— We'll see, — Pozzi smirked and stared at the gray fog outside the window.

The helicopter flew nowhere, and the counter in the notebook still showed 1528 and waited for new numbers.
