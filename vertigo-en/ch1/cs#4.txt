ch1-cs#4: Ash and Walls

Pozzi finished the last burger, washed it down with cola, and leaned back in the chair satisfactorily. Food was excellent, just like in the real Vegas he dreamed of (or did he?) upstairs.

— Fine, time to move on, — he said, getting up.

Floor 254 remained behind. The staircase led down.

253rd Floor

The door was ajar. Pozzi pushed it and entered a small room resembling an old guardhouse. A light bulb under the ceiling dimly flickered, an iron bed stood in the corner, and an old man sat on a stool.

Old—very old, with a long gray beard, in a torn sheepskin coat. He stared at one spot and didn't move.

— Hey, — Pozzi called. — Grandpa, who are you?

The old man slowly turned his head. His eyes were cloudy, like a hundred-year-old catfish.

— Huh? — he mumbled. — Who's here?

— Me, Pozzi. Passing by. You been sitting here long?

The old man thought, moved his lips, then answered:

— Long... nothing new... already 67 centuries...

— What? — Pozzi didn't understand. — 67 centuries? Are you immortal?

But the old man had already closed his eyes, sighed, and went limp. His last breath flew from his mouth, and he went still.

— Hey, grandpa! — Pozzi rushed over, shook him by the shoulder. — What's wrong? Don't die!

Too late. Grandpa departed to the next world.

— Well there, — Pozzi was upset. — Didn't even talk properly.

He noticed a small metal capsule on the table, similar to one used for carrying ashes. A note lay next to it: "WHEN I DIE, TAKE ME WITH YOU."

— Strange old man, — Pozzi shrugged. — Fine, since you asked...

He carefully collected the old man's ashes into the capsule (they scattered right before his eyes) and screwed the cap on. Then he remembered he had the molecule multiplier (that very liquid from the medkit on vertigo) and dripped one drop on the capsule.

The capsule glowed weakly and went dark.

— Let it be, — Pozzi decided and put it in his pocket. — Might come in handy.

Didn't write it in the notebook—grandpa died on his own, not by Pozzi's hands.

251st Floor

Pozzi descended lower. "251" was marked on the sign. He approached the door—and gasped.

Instead of a door was a solid concrete wall. Gray, cold, without a single crack.

— What the hell is this? — Pozzi knocked—hollow. — How do I go further?

He walked further along the staircase—the next door was only on 241. Between 251 and 241, judging by the flights, there were no floors. Emptiness.

— Fine, — Pozzi sighed. — Minus ten floors. Let's go to 241.

241st Floor

He opened the door and almost fell because there was no floor. Or rather, the floor was where the ceiling should be. The whole room was upside down: chandeliers stuck out of the floor, chairs hung on the ceiling, and a void yawned above his head (under his feet?).

— Damn, — Pozzi exhaled, clutching the doorframe. — How do I walk here?

He tried to step inside, but gravity didn't switch—he remained standing on the door, which was now a vertical wall. Then Pozzi guessed: need to jump and grab what's above.

He ran, jumped, and grabbed the leg of an upside-down table. Pulled himself up and found himself on the "ceiling," which was now the floor. Everything turned upside down, including his самочувствие.

— Fine then, — he said, walking across the ceiling. — Main thing is not to fall.

He walked through the inverted hall, trying not to look down (there was an abyss below), and got out to the staircase on the other side. The staircase was also inverted, but Pozzi simply jumped and landed on the next landing normally.

200th Floor

Another concrete wall. But this time a black axe was taped to it with scotch tape. A regular axe, matte, with a blade that didn't shine.

— Oh, an axe, — Pozzi was delighted. — Might come in handy for breaking walls.

He peeled off the scotch tape, took the axe in his hands—and it immediately crumbled to dust. Right before his eyes. First cracks appeared, then pieces fell, and within seconds nothing remained of the axe but a pile of black dust.

— Oh damn! — Pozzi exclaimed. — What a day? Everything crumbles!

He tried to gather the dust, but it slipped through his fingers.

— Fine, not meant to be.

199th Floor

Pozzi opened the door and froze.

There was...
