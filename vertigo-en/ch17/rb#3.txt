Pozzi came home.

Apartment. Ordinary. Cozy.

— Home, — he said.

Took off shoes. Went to room.

Computer. Bed. Window.

Everything in place.

— Real, — he said.

Touched the wall.

Solid.

— Not a glitch.

Lay on bed.

Ceiling white.

— Without bugs, — he said.

Closed eyes.

Silence.

— Without stairs.

Smiled.

— Without kills.

Notebook in pocket.

Took it out.

Looked.

1800 / 2000

— Enough, — he said.

Tore out the page.

Tore it.

Threw it away.

— Over.

Stood up.

Went to window.

Miami at night.

Lights.

— Beautiful, — he said.

— Yes, — a voice said.

— Luna?

— No.

— Who?

— Memory.

— Why?

— To remind.

— About what?

— That you passed.

— Why remember?

— To appreciate.

— What?

— This.

— Life?

— Yes.

— Thanks.

— You're welcome.

Voice faded.

Pozzi looked at lights.

Lived.
