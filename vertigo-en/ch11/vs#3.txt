ch11-vs#3: Exodus

In the morning, five decided to go. Others stayed.

— We're used to it, — the old man said. — This is our home.

— Good luck, — Pozzi said.

They exited. Storm ended, but earth still shimmered.

— Where are we going? — one survivor asked.

— To the 700th.

— And where's that?

— Further.

They walked. After an hour, a wall appeared ahead. Huge, to the sky.

— Dead end? — woman asked.

— No, — Luna said. — Passage.

She approached the wall, touched it. A door appeared.

— Behind it is 700th.

— And then?

— Then another 1300 levels.

— Why?

— To return home, — Pozzi said.

— Home... — woman thought. — I forgot what that is.

— You'll remember.

They passed through the door.

Wall disappeared behind.
