ch0-tt#2: Prime

Pozzi was descending the staircase from point A to point B when he heard that sound. First a low hum, then a growing howl, and then—the piercing shriek of thousands of throats.

— What the... — he stopped, peering into the darkness of the landing.

Down there, a mass was writhing. It shimmered with fur, tails, ears. Furries. Many furries. Very many furries.

Pozzi pulled out his notebook, quickly calculated in his head. If he'd made seventeen today, and sixty-seven in total, then now... He tried to count but lost track because the horde had already spotted him and was charging up with wild screams.

— Seems I stepped in an anthill, he muttered and spat downward. The spit landed on some fox's snout, but the fox didn't even notice.

The earpiece crackled: "Pozzi, get out of there! There are one thousand four hundred forty-eight of them! I repeat, 1448 individuals! That's the whole server! This is..."

The connection cut off. Apparently, the dispatcher got eaten too.

Pozzi tossed the earpiece aside and unbuttoned the top button of his shirt. The brown plaid swelled with wind that blew from nowhere.

— Well then, he said to himself. — Time to go prime.

He closed his eyes. Wind began to build around him. The furries on the staircase froze for a moment, sensing something wrong. The bravest wolf stepped forward and immediately recoiled—golden flame began erupting from Pozzi's body.

— AAAAAAAAH! — Pozzi roared, and it wasn't a cry of pain, but a cry of rage.

His hair, already brown, flared up and shot upward, turning golden like Goku after another training session with Vegeta. His eyes glowed not red, but bright blue. Muscles swelled with power, his shirt creaked at the seams but held—plaid can withstand anything.

— I AM POZZITIFON! — he growled in a voice mixing godly wrath and plumber's irritation. — AND YOU ARE TRASH!

And he jumped straight into the crowd.

What happened next couldn't be called a shootout. It was a massacre. Chaos.

The furries, sensing death, began to change themselves. Their eyes filled with blood, fur stood on end, foam dripped from their jaws. They were turning into zombie-wolves—rabid, angry, invulnerable to ordinary bullets. But Pozzi had no bullets. Pozzi had fists, feet, and eye lasers.

— HA-HA-HA! — he laughed, smashing faces one after another. — COME ON, CRITTERS, BRING IT!

He grabbed one wolf by the tail and started spinning it like a lasso, knocking down others. The wolf howled, tried to bite his hand, but Pozzi only tightened his grip.

— The circus left, but the clowns stayed! — he shouted and hurled the wolf into the crowd, clearing a path.

Zombie-furries pressed on. There were hundreds of them. They climbed over corpses, bit each other in their fervor, but Pozzi was faster. He jumped among them like a mad Trevor Philips after a bottle of firewater. His plaid shirt was already torn, hair stood on end, a wild grin frozen on his face.

— OH, YES! VEGAS! I REMEMBER VEGAS! — he cried, remembering the casino, and something human flickered in his eyes, but immediately drowned in madness. — BUT RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT A PARTY HERE!

Eye lasers sliced in a fan, cutting off dozens of heads at once. Heads fell, rolled across the floor, but zombie-wolves kept coming. There were too many of them. But Pozzi didn't care.

— THIS IS BETTER THAN BLACKJACK! — he roared, tearing the spine from another monster and using it as a bat.

He raced around point B, smashing crates, exploding air conditioners, his body glowing gold. The battle lasted an eternity. Minutes, hours, days—time on vertigo flowed differently. Finally, when the last zombie-wolf exploded into pieces from a kick in the style of Son Goku, Pozzi stopped.

Silence. Only the hum of ventilation and the smell of burnt fur.

Pozzi breathed heavily, standing in the middle of a mountain of corpses. His prime mode began to fade, hair darkened back to brown, eyes dimmed. He surveyed the battlefield—1448 furries lay around him.

— What a stench, he grimaced, wiping sweat from his forehead. — Gotta get out of here fast before the admins show up.

He remembered the helicopter. The one that always stood at point A. The perfect way to get to the real Vegas, not this cardboard knockoff.

Pozzi sprinted upstairs, jumping over remains. He ran up the staircase, past broken windows, past the spot where an hour ago (or a year?) he'd sat in ambush. Burst out onto the roof.

And froze.

The helicopter was there. But it wasn't right. Blades broken, cabin smashed, tail torn off and lying aside. Several furry mechanics in overalls scurried around it, but they were dead too—apparently blown up by their own shoddy repairs.

Pozzi slowly approached the wreckage. Ran his hand over the broken glass. Inside, on the seat, lay a "Bellagio" casino brochure with fountains.

— You... broke... my helicopter, he said quietly.

Wind tousled his hair. He clenched his fists. Eyes began to fill with red again.

— I wanted to go to the casino... — his voice trembled. — I wanted to go to a bachelor party... to Monroe...

He looked up at the sky, where the neon of ghostly Vegas still burned.

— Now I'll never get there.

Pause. Silence. And suddenly Pozzi laughed. First quietly, then louder, then burst out laughing at the top of his lungs, like a mad Trevor who found a new way to have fun.

— No matter! — he shouted into the void. — I'll make my own Vegas here! I'll build a casino from your bones, furries! And the roulette will spin from my eye lasers!

He turned to point B, where the remains of 1448 zombie-wolves still smoked.

— That was a warm-up, he smirked, and prime mode flashed again for a second in his pupils. — Next time, bring an army. I'll be waiting.

From his pocket, he pulled out his notebook, found the page with number 67, crossed it out, and wrote in bold digits:

1448 + 67 = 1515

— Beautiful number, he snorted. — Almost like a jackpot.

And, adjusting his torn plaid shirt, Pozzi, aka pozzitifon, aka the furry-killer with laser eyes, went to find something to eat. After all, after such a cleanup, lunch was in order.

And the broken helicopter remained on the roof, a reminder of the unfulfilled dream of real Las Vegas.
