ch16-sh#3: Light

Shadows disappeared. Light remained.

— Passed? — Pozzi asked.

— Yes, — Luna said. — Forgiveness is the key.

— To what?

— To 1800th.

— Where is it?

— Behind the light.

— Let's go?

— Let's go.

They walked through light.

Warm. Calm. Quiet.

— Luna...

— Yes?

— Thanks.

— For what?

— For everything.

— You're welcome.

— For what then?

— For being.

— Was?

— Yes.

— What does it mean?

— You'll see.

— Again?!

— Sorry.

— Okay.

Exited the light.

Door.

Huge. White.

— 1800th, — Luna said.

— Home?

— Almost.

— What does almost mean?

— Door is not the last.

— What's behind it?

— Choice.

— Which?

— You'll see.

— Luna!

— Sorry.

She turned away.

Pozzi sighed.

Approached the door.
