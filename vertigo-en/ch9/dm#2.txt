ch9-dm#2: Author

Fingers ran across the keyboard. Words appeared by themselves.

def kill_author():
    pozzi = Player()
    pozzi.power = INFINITE
    return author.die()

— What are you doing? — the man asked.

— Writing your end.

— You can't. I'm the author. I created you.

— And I'm a character. Who became real.

Screen flickered. Code lines turned into blood.

— Do you understand what will happen? Everything will disappear. Vertigo, furries, skeletons... you.

— Better to disappear than be a puppet.

Pozzi pressed Enter.

Room shook. The man disintegrated into letters.

— Noooo...

He dissolved. A manuscript on the table: "VERTIGO. Chapter 1".

Pozzi turned the page — and saw himself. Literally drawn, with a gun, with a notebook.

— I'm really a character...

Everything disappeared. Room, table, manuscript — into white sheets.

Pozzi in emptiness. Manuscript in hands.

— And now?

Luna's voice:

— Now you're the author. Write your story.

— I can't.

— You'll learn. 1999 levels in reserve.

Emptiness filled with text. Lines, paragraphs, chapters — about him.

He started reading.

(To be continued...)
