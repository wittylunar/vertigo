ch3-sp#8: Endless Chase

— Run! — Pozzi shouted, and he and Bill sprinted up the staircase.

Thunder rumbled behind—skeletons in Red Army uniforms broke through after them, shooting on the move. Bullets clicked against walls, knocking out crumbs.

— How many of them?! — Bill shouted, jumping over three steps.

— Many! — Pozzi answered. — Very many!

-2... -3... -4... Signs flashed before their eyes. The staircase went down and up simultaneously—seemed they ran in both directions at once, but skeletons didn't fall behind.

On floor -5 a new group of Red Army men fell out of a side door. Pozzi fired from his gun, took out three, but others were already climbing.

— How many of you are there?! — he shouted.

— It's their casino! — Bill reminded, throwing cartridges at nearest skulls. — They have something to fight for!

-6... -7... -8... There were more and more skeletons. They climbed out of every door, from every crack. Seemed the whole basement teemed with bony defenders of the Soviet casino.

— I'm starting to get tired! — Bill admitted, almost out of cartridges for throwing.

— Don't you dare! — Pozzi snapped. — We'll make it!

-9... -10... -11... The staircase wound, went into a spiral, sometimes it seemed they ran in circles. But skeletons were everywhere—above, below, to the side.

-12... -13... -14... Pozzi was already shooting without aiming, just into the crowd. Bill threw empty casings because bullets ran out.

-15... -16... -17... They were out of breath, but ran. Adrenaline and eternal satiety pills kept them on their feet, but strength was running out.

-18... -19... -20... Skeletons were almost catching up. Bony fingers reached for their backs.

-21... -22!

Pozzi flew out onto the landing and saw a cabinet. Old, shabby, with a crooked door. A sign hung on it: "DO NOT OPEN! (BUT IF NEEDED—SALVATION IS HERE)."

— THIS WAY! — Pozzi shouted, flying into the cabinet and dragging Bill behind him.

The door slammed shut. Skeletons thundered outside, knocked with bony fists on the wood.

— Are we saved? — Bill whispered.

— Don't know, — Pozzi answered.

At that moment the floor under them gave way. The cabinet fell into endless darkness. They fell, tumbled, and suddenly...

BOOM!

They were thrown out into a black hole. Not into space, but exactly into a hole—absolutely black space where nothing was. No walls, no floor, no sound. Only the two of them, floating in emptiness.

— Where are we? — Bill whispered.

— In a black hole, seems, — Pozzi answered.

And then they were BURST.

A stream gushed from nowhere. Not water, but something else—shadows, bones, bullets, flags, cartridges, skeletons, machines, cigarettes, caps. Everything they'd seen in the last hours обрушилось on them from all sides.

— A-A-A-A! — Bill screamed, covering his head with his hands.

— HOLD ON! — Pozzi shouted, but he was already being wound into the vortex.

The stream was irresistible. It tore them into pieces, mixed with debris, ground them. Pozzi felt his body disintegrate into atoms, how the notebook flew out of his pocket and disappeared into black emptiness.

The last thing he saw—number 1538, which glowed before his eyes and slowly melted.

And then—DARKNESS.

Somewhere in the void...

— Hey, — Bill's voice came from nowhere. — Pozzi, you alive?

— Don't know, — Pozzi's voice answered. — And you?

— Don't know either. We were destroyed, right?

— Seems so.

— So what now?

Silence. Then Pozzi said:

— Now, probably, there'll be a new chapter.

— And where?

— Don't know. Maybe in the next chat?

— Yeah. Well, let's then...

— Let's.

Their voices faded, dissolving in the endless black hole.
