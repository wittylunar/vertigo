ch10-oc#3: Void

They ended up in the void. Nothing there. No walls, no floor, no light.

— Where are we? — Pozzi whispered.

— Between levels, — Luna answered. — No rules here.

— How to go?

— Just walk.

They walked. Steps sounded strange, like in water.

Time passed. Or didn't? Unclear.

— Luna, how long have we been walking?

— Don't know. No time here.

Suddenly a light ahead. Small dot.

— What's there?

— Exit. Or trap.

They walked toward the light. Dot grew, turning into a door.

Pozzi opened.

Behind it — a room. Ordinary, with bed, table, window.

— This is... my room? — Pozzi recognized wallpaper, computer, posters.

— No, — Luna said. — It's an illusion.

— But looks real...

He went to the window. Behind it Miami, beach, ocean.

— Want to go home, — he said quietly.

— I know. But too early.

— How much more?

— 1600 levels.

Pozzi clenched his fists.

— Then let's go.

(To be continued...)
