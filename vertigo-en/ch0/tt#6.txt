ch0-tt#6: Choice Problem

Pozzi caught his breath after the run from the radioactive Colosseum and walked toward the light. The corridor gradually widened, walls became cleaner, and ahead loomed a door with a sign "VIP Lounge." Music, laughter, and clinking glasses came from inside.

— Oh, at least they'll give me food here? — Pozzi muttered hopefully and pushed the door.

Inside was a luxurious hall. Soft couches, bar counter, neon lighting. And two people. One sat in a chair with legs on the table, the second stood nearby with a bottle in hand. Both were in bandages, casts, and bruises. But they were easily recognizable.

— Come on, — Pozzi exhaled. — The helicopter tore you apart.

MORGENSTERN, alive, though battered, lazily turned his head. Next to him stood Timati in a torn tank top and with a cast on his arm.

— Oh, another one, — Timati grunted. — Ali, there's a visitor here.

MORGENSTERN looked at Pozzi with a dull gaze, recognized the plaid shirt, and a complex range of emotions appeared on his face: from horror to dull realization.

— Listen, — he began, trying to stand up, but his leg in a cast gave way. — I got a problem...

And just then from the speakers, which had been playing quietly all this time, it blasted:

"—E-E-El Primero with a huge d*ck!"

MORGENSTERN jerked as if electrocuted, and for some reason joined in:

"—I got a problem: Lambo' or Ferra'?"

— Oh, the chorus started, — Timati perked up and also joined in, despite the cast: "—Big boys playing big toys!"

Pozzi froze in the doorway. He looked at these two crippled rappers trying to perform a concert to a backing track, and something clicked in his head.

— Are you serious? — he asked.

"—E-E-El Primero with a huge d*ck!" — MORGENSTERN continued shouting, waving his only healthy arm.

"—I got a problem: Lambo' or Ferra'?" — Timati echoed, trying to make a serious face, but with the cast it looked comical.

Pozzi silently approached them. The rappers didn't pay attention—they were busy with creativity. MORGENSTERN was just finishing the line:

"—Making bombs, but I'm not from ISI—"

— Excuse me, — Pozzi interrupted. — I was just passing by. Could you tell me where the cafeteria is?

MORGENSTERN stopped mid-word. Looked at Timati. Timati at him.

— Can't you see we're recording? — MORGENSTERN was offended. — We're shooting a video here!

— Yeah, — Timati nodded. — Rehearsing. I got a solo show soon.

— I see, — Pozzi sighed. — So what problem did you have?

— What problem? — MORGENSTERN didn't understand.

— Well, you said "I got a problem." I thought maybe I could help.

MORGENSTERN slapped his healthy hand on his forehead:

— It's lyrics! From the song! What, you don't know? "I got a problem: Lambo' or Ferra'?" You know, choosing between cars!

— A-a-a, — Pozzi drawled. — Got it. Well, I guess I'll go.

— Freeze! — Timati suddenly shouted. — I remember! This is that psycho who threw Ali into the helicopter!

MORGENSTERN jerked, trying to jump up, but the cast wouldn't let him. He grabbed a bottle from the table and raised it:

— You little—!

Pozzi didn't even flinch. He just watched as two crippled rappers tried to organize resistance. Then he sighed, walked up to MORGENSTERN, easily took the bottle, put it on the table, and in one motion—crack!—snapped his neck.

MORGENSTERN froze with his mouth open, from which another "El Primero" never flew out.

Timati gasped and tried to run, but Pozzi caught him in two steps.

— What, what are you doing, — Timati stammered. — I'm Timati! I got contracts! I left Black Star! I'm legendary, like Pink Floyd!

— Pink Floyd doesn't sing about huge d*cks, — Pozzi noted indifferently and sent Timati into a knockout with one punch. Forever.

He picked up both bodies—MORGENSTERN and Timati—by the scruff, dragged them to the window, threw open the sash and tossed them out. The bodies synchronously disappeared into the darkness.

— Eh, — Pozzi said, looking down. — They said rappers don't fall. They fall, oh yes they do.

He took out his notebook. 1520. Added:

+2 = 1522

— Although MORGENSTERN was already counted, — he pondered. — But since he survived and got caught again, we recount. From scratch.

Put away the notebook, surveyed the VIP lounge. Food stood on the table—some canapés, fruits, bottles. Pozzi quickly had a snack, washed it down with mineral water, and went back out to the staircase.

Had to descend further. Down, down, to where maybe his casino awaited. Or a new portion of madmen.

He walked down the steps, counting floors: 615... 610... 605... 600...

On 599 he stopped.

Because he saw IT.
