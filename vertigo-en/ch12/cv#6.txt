ch12-cv#6: Crossroads

Level 1300 — crossroads. Four roads.

— Where? — Pozzi asked.

— Choose.

— What if wrong?

— No wrong paths. Only different ones.

— Which to 1800th?

— All. But differently.

— Explain.

— Left — fast, dangerous. Right — long, safe. Straight — medium. Back — beginning.

— Back?

— Yes. Can start over.

— I don't want to.

— Then choose.

Pozzi looked at the roads.

— And you where?

— I'm with you. Wherever you go.

— Then... straight.

— Sure?

— No. But going.

— Wise.

They went straight. Road smooth, no obstacles.

— Why so easy?

— Because you know the path.

— From where?

— From inside.

— How much more?

— 500 levels.

— Closer.

— Yes. But remember — the closer, the harder.

— Why?

— Because system doesn't let go.

— It's alive?

— In a way.

— And what does it want?

— Doesn't know. Like you.

They walked. Road wound.

In the notebook: 1005 / 2000.
