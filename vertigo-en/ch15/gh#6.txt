ch15-gh#6: Descent

Descended from the mountain quickly.

— Why fast? — Pozzi asked.

— Because mountain accepted.

— What?

— You.

— Why?

— So you pass.

— Where?

— To 1700th.

— What's there?

— Test.

— Which?

— Last one before finale.

— Which?

— You'll see.

— Tell me!

— Can't.

— Why?!

— Because you must yourself.

— Luna...

— Sorry.

— For what?

— For what will happen.

— What will happen?

— You'll see.

— Enough!

— Sorry.

She was silent.

Pozzi too.

Walked in silence.

1700th approached.

In the notebook: 1505 / 2000.
