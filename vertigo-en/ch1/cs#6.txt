ch1-cs#6: Jump Through Reality

Pozzi descended the staircase, still digesting the fragment of the radio message. 198th floor. He pushed the door and stepped inside.

And immediately understood something was wrong with this place.

First, the floor wasn't everywhere. Or rather, it was, but you could only walk in certain directions, and in others—you'd fall into infinity. Second, walls changed color and texture every second: now brick, now wood, now starry sky. Third, a table stood in the corner, and a person sat on a chair who was simultaneously here, and there, and generally somewhere incomprehensible.

— Laws of physics haven't been invented here yet, — Pozzi guessed. — Or already forgotten.

He cautiously stepped forward, trying to step only on floor sections that looked solid. Suddenly ahead, through the shimmering space, he saw a concrete wall. Same as on 251, solid, insurmountable. But before the wall stood an old slot machine from the casino—with a handle, screen, and blinking lights.

Pozzi approached closer. An inscription displayed on the machine's screen:

DANGER ATTA....

— Atta... Attack? — Pozzi read. — What the...

And at that moment the machine sparked. First the screen flashed, then smoke poured from inside, then flames burst out, and the inscription went out forever.

— Oh, — Pozzi said and sprinted back.

He ran, not looking at the road, jumping over holes in the floor, passing through changing walls. Staircase! Where's the staircase? There it is—a door!

Pozzi flew out onto the stair landing and, without looking, ran down. Steps flashed under his feet, numbers on signs blurred into one strip. 180... 160... 140... 120... 100... 80... 60...

He ran a long time. Very long. Until he realized the floors had ended.

— 54th, — he read on the sign, stopping and gasping for air. — How so fast? I only came from 198th...

He looked back. The staircase went up, disappearing into darkness. Probably while he ran in panic, gravity or time did its job. Or the laws of physics on 198 infected the staircase.

— Fine, — Pozzi caught his breath. — What have we got here?

He pushed the 54th floor door and froze. Because he saw something that made even him, who'd been through furries, zombies, and rappers, catch his breath.

It was a huge hall filled with monitors and instruments. Lights blinked, generators hummed, and in the center, in a huge glass capsule, something floated. A mutant. Huge, with multiple eyes and tentacles, it slowly rotated in liquid.

An inscription glowed on the capsule:

SPECIMEN 67-A
STATUS: ACTIVE
DANGER: CRITICAL

A console stood next to the capsule, and another radio lay on it. A voice came from it:

— ...If you hear this, Pozzi, don't approach the capsule. The mutant will awaken. Run to the 13th floor. There's a portal to the real casino there. And take grandpa's ashes—he's the scientist who created this nightmare. His ashes are the only thing that can destroy...

The radio crackled and fell silent.

Pozzi looked at the capsule. The mutant opened one eye and stared right at him.

— Oh, — Pozzi said and sprinted back to the staircase.

Glass clanged behind him, and a terrible roar sounded.

— To 13th! — Pozzi shouted, jumping over steps. — Just gotta make it!

The staircase carried him down again, and destruction thundered behind his back—the mutant was breaking free.

(To be continued...)
