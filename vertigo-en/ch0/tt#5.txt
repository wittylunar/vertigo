ch0-tt#5: Nuclear Reactor

Pozzi descended lower and lower. The vertigo staircase seemed endless. 650... 640... 630... Numbers flashed before his eyes, blending into a monotonous gray stream. He no longer thought about furries, or cabbage girls, or rappers. He thought about only one thing: what the hell was he even doing here and why still hadn't he reached the casino?

On floor 627 something changed. The air grew hotter, smelled of metal and something else strange, like ozone before a storm. And most importantly—a light appeared ahead. Bright, unnatural, pulsing.

Pozzi quickened his pace. The staircase ended and he emerged onto a wide landing. What he saw made him freeze.

It was the Colosseum. A real Roman Colosseum, built right inside the skyscraper. Arenas, stands, sand—and all this on the 627th floor. In the center of the arena stood some huge construction resembling a giant robot, and around it bustled a person in a red-gold suit.

— Holy division, — Pozzi whispered. — That's Tony Stark.

The person in the suit really did look like Iron Man. True, without a helmet, and clearly concerned about something. He was fussing with the robot, connecting it to a bunch of wires and some instruments.

Pozzi stepped forward to get a better look, and just then a grate slammed shut behind him with a clang. He tugged it—locked. Massive bars, electronic lock, no way to break out immediately.

— Hey! — Pozzi shouted, shaking the grate. — What the hell? Open up!

Tony Stark didn't even turn around. He kept fussing with the robot, muttering something under his breath. And the robot... the robot began showing signs of life.

It was a behemoth about five meters tall, bristling with guns. Pozzi quickly counted: eleven barrels of various calibers protruded from its body, arms, and shoulders. The robot's eyes glowed red, and a mechanical voice boomed:

— Defense protocol activation. Target detected.

— What? — Pozzi didn't understand.

And then from the darkness, from behind the columns, came someone's unpleasant, creaky voice:

— Tony Stark, sitting in colonization, assembled a nuclear reactor!

Pozzi turned toward the voice but saw no one. Only shadows danced on the walls.

— What? — he repeated. — What colonization? Who's sitting?

But the robot was already moving. Its mechanical legs creaked, guns shifted, aiming at Pozzi.

— Prepare yourself, — the robot droned. — May the earth rest easy on you, organic trash.

— Go to hell, — Pozzi snapped back. — I fought furries, eye lasers don't get me, and you're here with your guns...

And then Pozzi did what the robot clearly didn't expect. He simply spat.

The spit landed right in the joint between armor plates, where some wires ran. Hissing erupted, sparks flew in all directions, and the robot convulsed.

— Emergency situation! — the mechanical voice screamed. — Short circuit! Self-destruct protocol activated!

— What? — Tony Stark finally turned around. His eyes widened in horror. — No, wait! There's a nuclear...

He didn't finish. The robot began sparking with tenfold force. Smoke poured from all cracks, then flames appeared. Tony Stark tried to run but tripped over some wires and fell right next to the robot.

— Ow! — was all he managed to cry out before flames engulfed him too.

Pozzi watched all this through the grate. The robot burned, sparked, crackled. About fifteen seconds passed—and then an explosion came.

BOOM!

A shockwave rolled through the Colosseum, shattering windows and breaking columns. Pozzi flew back from the grate but quickly jumped to his feet. The Colosseum was collapsing before their eyes. Huge chunks of stone fell from the ceiling, the arena floor gave way, and green light beat from below—apparently that very nuclear reactor Tony Stark had assembled.

— Radiation! — Pozzi realized.

He ran to the grate, which miraculously survived, and pulled with all his might. Once, twice, three times. Metal groaned but held. Then Pozzi ran and jumped, ramming the grate with his shoulder.

The grate flew out together with a piece of wall.

Pozzi tumbled out onto the staircase, jumped up and sprinted downward, not looking at the road. Behind him everything still thundered and exploded. The Colosseum finally collapsed, burying Tony Stark, the robot, and the nuclear reactor beneath it.

— Damn, damn, damn! — Pozzi muttered, jumping over steps. — Faster!

He ran as fast as he could. 626... 625... 620... 615... Legs hummed, heart pounded somewhere in his throat. Behind him heat could still be felt, and the air was becoming somehow strange, metallic.

613th floor. The staircase led him to a regular landing, without any Colosseums. Regular doors, regular walls. Pozzi flew inside, slammed the door behind him and leaned against it with his back, breathing heavily.

— Phew, — he exhaled. — Seems I made it.

He stood there a minute, another, listening to himself. Head didn't spin, hair didn't fall out, foam didn't come from his mouth. Seemed alive.

Pozzi took out his notebook. Hands shook slightly.

— Tony Stark, — he mumbled, writing. — Blew up together with his robot. That's plus one. Although who knows, maybe he survived? But unlikely.

He added to number 1519:

+1 = 1520

— And the robot, — he pondered. — Should I count the robot? It's not alive. But it had guns... Fine, we don't count robots.

He put away the notebook and looked around. Regular floor, regular corridors. Somewhere far away music could be heard, similar to what the cabbage girls played, but quieter. And there was a smell of food. Real food.

— I'm hungry, — Pozzi admitted. — Maybe there's a cafeteria here?

He peeled himself from the door and walked down the corridor. Ahead light loomed, and voices came from there. Many voices. And laughter.

— Just don't tell me there are furries there again, — Pozzi groaned. — I'm tired. I want to eat. And get to the casino.

But he still went toward the light. Because there was no choice.
