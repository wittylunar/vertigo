ch10-oc#5: Elevator

They found themselves in an elevator. Old, with lattice door.

— 500th floor, — Luna said and pressed the button.

Elevator shuddered, moved. But strangely — not up, but sideways.

— Elevator goes sideways?

— This is Vertigo elevator. Laws don't work here.

Levels flashed outside the window. 400, 450, 500...

Elevator stopped. Door opened.

— Arrived.

They exited into a corridor. On the wall: "LEVEL 500 — MAZE".

— Maze?

— Yes. Need to find the exit.

— What if we get lost?

— Will walk forever.

— Great.

They entered the maze. Walls high, made of mirrors.

— Why everything is mirrored?

— Because the maze is you. Every turn is your choice.

They walked. Corridors, turns, dead ends.

After an hour:

— Luna, we've been here before.

— Yes. It's a trap.

— How to exit?

— Stop looking for exit.

— What?!

— Maze feels fear. Must not be afraid.

Pozzi closed his eyes.

— I'm not afraid.

— Then walk.

He walked. Walls parted.

(To be continued...)
