ch17-rb#1: Reality

Pozzi sat on Miami beach. Sun warmed, waves rustled.

— Real? — he asked aloud.

— Yes, — someone answered.

Pozzi turned. A man sat nearby. About forty, in glasses, with a notebook.

— Who are you?

— Author.

— What author?

— The one who wrote.

— You created me?

— Yes.

— Why?

— To tell a story.

— Which?

— Yours.

— Mine?

— Yes.

— But I'm a character!

— And human.

— How?

— In Vertigo, anything is possible.

— Where's Vertigo?

— Everywhere.

— Even here?

— Yes.

— But I got out!

— Can't get out. Can only understand.

— What?

— That everything is a story.

— And you?

— Too.

— Then who writes you?

— Another.

— And so on to infinity?

— Yes.

Pozzi was silent.

— Is this bad? — author asked.

— No.

— Then live.

— How?

— Simply.

— Without bugs?

— Without bugs.

— Without stairs?

— Without stairs.

— Promise?

— Promise.

Author stood up.

— Goodbye, Pozzi.

— See you later.

— No. Goodbye.

He disappeared.

Pozzi remained.

On beach.

Real.
