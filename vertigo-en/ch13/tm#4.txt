ch13-tm#4: Forest

Level 1600 — forest. Dense, dark, alive.

— Where are we? — Pozzi asked.

— Don't know. Portal was wrong.

— How so?

— Portals lie. Sometimes.

— Where does this forest lead?

— To 1700th. But path is long.

— How long?

— Don't know. Forest decides.

— Forest decides?

— Yes. It's alive.

Trees rustled. Branches moved.

— Am I imagining it, or are they watching?

— Not imagining.

— Dangerous?

— Yes. But we'll pass.

They walked on the path. Trees parted.

— Why letting us through?

— Because they feel the goal.

— What goal?

— Home.

— Forest knows?

— Yes. Knows everything.

A clearing ahead. An old man on it.

— Who's this? — Pozzi whispered.

— Forest keeper.

— Dangerous?

— No. Will help.

They approached.
