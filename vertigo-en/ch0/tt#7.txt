ch0-tt#7: Medkit

Pozzi froze on the 599th floor. What he saw made him rub his eyes—maybe the radiation had finally reached his brain?

A person crawled down the corridor. Or rather, what remained of him. Burnt, smoking, with skin hanging in shreds, he slowly moved toward a medkit hanging on the wall. Hoarse, terrible sounds escaped his mouth that gave even Pozzi goosebumps.

— A-a-a-a... — the person drawled. — Hu-u-u-rts...

Pozzi looked closer and recognized the red shreds of a suit.

— Tony Stark? — he was surprised. — Didn't you blow up with the Colosseum?

Tony turned his head—it hung by one muscle—and croaked:

— Radiation... I'm immortal... Help... Crawl...

— Yeah, right, — Pozzi snorted. — Like I'd run to help.

He approached Tony, who had almost reached the medkit. A hand in a burnt glove scraped along the wall an inch from the precious box with a red cross.

— Well, Iron Man, — Pozzi squatted down. — Rich, smart, build suits. But can't crawl to a medkit.

— He-elp... — Tony rasped. — I'll pay... Money... Technologies...

— Don't need your technologies, — Pozzi waved off. — I need to get to the casino. And you're in my way.

And with one easy motion he cut off Tony's head. It rolled across the floor, stopped at the wall. Tony went still.

Pozzi took the head by the hair, approached the window, intending to throw it out, but just then a squelching sound came from behind. He turned around.

Tentacles crawled out of the neck of the beheaded body, twisted, braided, and within seconds a NEW head formed on the shoulders. Tony opened his eyes, blinked, and crawled toward the medkit again.

— What the?! — Pozzi blurted out.

— Radiation... — the new Tony croaked. — I'm like a lizard now... Regrow everything...

— Oh boy, — Pozzi scratched the back of his head. — How do I kill you now?

He looked around. His gaze fell on a stove—an old gas-powered heater, with an open door, flames blazing inside.

— What if I burn you? — Pozzi pondered.

Tony heard this and started scraping faster:

— Don't! I'm good! I'm an Avenger!

— And I'm Pozzi, — he answered, picked up Tony by the leg, and, ignoring the screams, shoved him into the stove. Head first.

The door slammed shut. A muffled cry came from inside, smell of burnt meat arose, then everything went silent. Pozzi knocked on the stove—quiet.

— Well there, — he said satisfactorily. — Now it won't grow back.

He approached the medkit that Tony never managed to reach and opened it. Inside lay some pills, ampoules, and a small bottle labeled: "MOLECULE MULTIPLIER — 1 dose."

— Multiplier of what? — Pozzi turned the bottle in his hands. — Fine, I'll figure it out.

Next to it lay another pill—pink, labeled "ETERNAL SATIETY. Never want to eat AGAIN."

— Oh, — Pozzi was delighted. — Tired of eating those canapés in corners.

He popped the pill in his mouth, washed it down with the molecule multiplier (the liquid turned out sweetish, with a raspberry taste), and suddenly his body was pierced by wild pain. Every cell exploded like a firework, bones crunched, muscles twitched.

— A-a-a-a! — Pozzi screamed, falling to the floor. — What the hell?!

But the pain passed as quickly as it began. He stood up, brushed himself off, and listened to himself.

No hunger. At all. As if he'd just eaten a hearty meal. And most importantly—the cuts on his hands that he hadn't even noticed began to heal before his eyes. Scratches disappeared, bruises faded.

— Holy crap, — Pozzi whistled. — Now I'm like Usain Bolt, only I recover.

He took a step—and indeed, his body moved faster than before. Another step—total flight. Pozzi sped up and ran down the corridor back and forth so fast he almost hit the wall.

— Cool! — he laughed. — Now I'm faster than everyone!

He took out his notebook, found number 1522, added:

+1 = 1523

— Tony Stark, — he snorted. — Burned in the stove. Killed twice—does that count as one or two? Fine, let it be one.

He put away the notebook and ran further down. The staircase flashed before his eyes at incredible speed. 590... 585... 580...

On floor 578 he braked sharply. An axe lay on the floor. A regular axe, rusty, broken. Blade chipped, handle cracked.

— An axe, — Pozzi stated. — Broken. Well, who knows.

He stepped over it and ran further.

565... 550... 540... 530...

On floor 523, right in the middle of the stair landing, sat a doll. Old, worn, with faded hair and empty eyes. It looked straight at Pozzi.

He stopped. The doll didn't move.

— Hello, — Pozzi said. — Whose are you?

The doll was silent.

— Fine then, — Pozzi shrugged and ran further.

520... 510... 505... 500.

On the 500th floor he saw IT.

And stopped as if rooted to the spot.
