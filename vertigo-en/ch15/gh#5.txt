ch15-gh#5: Peak

Pozzi stepped on the peak.

Wind stopped.

Clouds below.

View of everything.

— Here it is, — Luna said.

— What?

— Everything.

— Where?

— Below.

Pozzi looked.

Levels flashed. 100, 200, 300... 1700.

— Passed...

— Yes.

— How much left?

— 200.

— 200?

— Yes. 1700, 1800...

— 1800 — home?

— Yes.

— Why 200?

— Because the last ones are the hardest.

— Why?

— System doesn't let go.

— Fights?

— Yes.

— Will I win?

— Must.

— What if not?

— You'll stay here.

— Forever?

— Yes.

Pozzi looked at the path.

— Won't stay.

— Know.

— How?

— Because you're Pozzi.

— That means?

— Yes. Stubborn.

— Thanks.

— You're welcome.

— Let's go.

— Let's go.
