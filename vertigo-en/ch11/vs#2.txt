ch11-vs#2: Bunker

Light in the bunker. People — about ten — sat at the table.

— New ones? — an old man asked.

— Yes, — Luna said. — Temporarily.

— For long?

— For the night.

— Then eat.

They were given bowls of porridge. Pozzi tried — tasteless, but edible.

— How long have you been here? — he asked.

— Don't remember, — the old man said. — Years? Decades?

— Why don't you leave?

— Where? Outside is death.

— But this is Vertigo level. Can go further.

— Vertigo? — old man smirked. — We thought it was hell.

— No. Just a test.

— Test for what?

— For survival.

Old man shook his head.

— We survived. And what? Trapped here.

— I can lead you out, — Pozzi said.

— How?

— Just follow me.

— What if we die?

— Better than rotting here?

People looked at each other.

— We'll think about it, — the old man said.

Pozzi nodded.

— You have until morning.
