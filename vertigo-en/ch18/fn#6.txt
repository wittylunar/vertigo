Pozzi walked.

On beach.

To water.

Stopped.

Looked at ocean.

— Over, — he said.

— No, — a voice said.

— Luna?

— Yes.

— Where are you?

— Here.

— Where here?

— In you.

— What do you mean?

— In memory.

— Why did you come?

— To escort.

— Where?

— Home.

— I'm already home.

— No. This was home.

— And now?

— Now real one.

— Where?

— In Vertigo.

— But I got out!

— Can't get out.

— What?!

— Can only understand.

— What?

— That everything is one.

— How one?

— Life. Death. Dream. Reality.

— Everything?

— Yes.

— And Vertigo?

— And Vertigo.

— And Miami?

— And Miami.

— Then where's truth?

— Everywhere.

— How to live?

— Simply.

— Without bugs?

— With bugs.

— Without stairs?

— With stairs.

— Why?

— Because that's the path.

— Mine?

— Yes.

— Walking?

— Walking.

— Where?

— Forward.

— Alone?

— No.

— Who with me?

— Everyone.

— Who everyone?

— Those who loved.

— You?

— Me.

— Thanks.

— You're welcome.

— Goodbye.

— No.

— Why?

— Because see you later.

— Will we meet?

— Yes.

— Where?

— In new story.

— Which?

— You'll see.

— When?

— Soon.

— Promise?

— Promise.

Pozzi closed his eyes.

Smiled.

Stepped.

Into water.

Into light.

Into new story.

THE END.

OR BEGINNING?
