ch13-tm#5: Keeper

Old man sat on a stump. Eyes closed.

— Greetings, travelers, — he said.

— How do you know? — Pozzi was surprised.

— Forest told.

— Forest talks?

— Yes. Everything talks. If you listen.

— We need to get to 1800th.

— I know.

— Will you show the way?

— Path is one. Through the heart.

— Where's the heart?

— In the forest.

— Far?

— Close. But dangerous.

— Why?

— Because the heart is guarded.

— By whom?

— By you.

— By me?!

— Yes. Your shadow is here.

— My shadow?

— The one that stayed. When you left.

— I didn't leave.

— You did. From yourself.

Pozzi was silent.

— How to pass?

— Defeat the shadow.

— How?

— Accept it.

— And that's it?

— And that's it.

— Where is it?

— In the clearing. Go.

Pozzi went.

Luna stayed.
