ch12-cv#4: Doors

Level 1100 met them with doors. Many doors. Hundreds.

— Which one to choose? — Pozzi asked.

— The one that's yours.

— How to know?

— Knock.

He knocked on the first. Silence.

On the second. Voice from behind: "Go away".

On the third. Laughter.

— Why different?

— Because doors are lives. Ones you didn't choose.

— Scary.

— Yes. But you chose yours.

— Which one?

— The one ahead.

They went to the last door. Huge, oak, with a key.

— This is it, — Luna said.

Pozzi inserted the key. Turned.

Door opened.

Behind it — stairs. Ordinary, gray, familiar.

— This is... the beginning?

— No. The middle.

— How much more?

— 700 levels.

— Why so few?

— Because the hardest are ahead.

— Why?

— Because closer to the end.

They walked up the stairs.

Door closed behind.
