ch16-sh#1: Shadows

Level 1700 met with darkness.

— Level 1700 — Kingdom of Shadows, — Luna said.

— Why shadows?

— Because fears live here.

— Mine?

— Yes.

— Which?

— You'll see.

— Show me!

— You'll see yourself.

They came out of darkness.

Furries. Skeletons. Venom. Corporat.

— Dead? — Pozzi whispered.

— Yes, — Luna said. — And no.

— How?

— Shadows. Memories.

— What do they want?

— Revenge.

— For what?

— For death.

— I'm not guilty!

— They know.

— Then why?!

— To pass the test.

— Which?

— Forgiveness.

— Won't!

— Must.

— No!

— Then you'll get stuck.

— Forever?

— Yes.

Shadows approached.

Eyes glowed.
