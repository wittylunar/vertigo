ch13-tm#1: Time Machine

Level 1400 met them with noise. Mechanisms, gears, steam.

— Level 1400 — Time Workshop, — Luna read.

— Time machine?

— Yes. Can see past and future.

— Want to see home!

— Can't. Only yours.

— My past?

— Yes.

Pozzi approached the machine. Huge, with levers, dials.

— How does it work?

— Turn the handle.

He turned. Numbers ran: 2025, 2024, 2023...

— Stop!

Machine shuddered. Screen showed: Miami, beach, him with friends.

— This is real?

— Yes. Your past.

— Want to return!

— Can't. Only watch.

— Why?!

— Because past is dead.

Pozzi hit the machine.

— Then show the future!

— Future is not written.

— Show it!

Luna nodded. Pozzi turned further.

Screen showed: Miami, but different. He sits on the beach, alone.

— Why alone?

— Because not everyone makes it.

— Who won't?

— You'll see.
