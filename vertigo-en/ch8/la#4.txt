ch8-la#4: Chase

The car shot into the sky. Three police drones behind, sirens wailing.

— Hold on! — Rocky turned the wheel, the car did a dead loop.

Drones opened fire. Laser beams pierced the air.

— They have weapons!

— And we have you! Remember your lasers!

Pozzi concentrated. His eyes glowed red. He shot — a drone exploded.

— Two more!

The second drone caught fire and fell. The third tried to escape — Pozzi caught it with his gaze.

— Yes! Let's break away!

They dove between skyscrapers. Sirens wailed behind, but no more drones.

— Where now?

— To the 100th floor. But there's a boss there. Chief guard of Vertigo. Corporat.

— What's he like?

— They say he was like you once. A traveler. But the system broke him.

The car began to descend. Below, a platform: "FLOOR 100 — BOSS ARENA".

— Good luck, dude.

Pozzi got out and stepped onto the platform.
