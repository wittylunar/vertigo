ch15-gh#2: Voices

Fog thickened. Voices got louder.

— Pozzi, stay...

— Pozzi, we miss you...

— Pozzi, you're ours...

— NO! — he screamed. — I'M NOT YOURS!

— Whose? — Luna asked.

— Mine.

— Sure?

— Yes.

— Then prove it.

— How?

— Pass.

— Through what?

— Through yourself.

A wall of fog ahead.

— This is it?

— Yes.

— How to pass?

— Through.

— Hurts?

— Yes.

— How much?

— A second.

— After?

— Freedom.

Pozzi breathed in.

Stepped.
