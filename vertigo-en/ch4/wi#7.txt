ch4-wi#7: Venom in the Casino

Pozzi flew down the stairs, not feeling his legs. Adrenaline was off the charts, pills worked to the limit, but fear was stronger. Behind, somewhere above, thundered — Venom broke down the door and now descended after him, destroying everything in his path.

— 30... 28... 25... — Pozzi counted, jumping over flights. — 23!

Twenty-third floor. A door with a sign was ajar, and dim reddish light poured from inside. Pozzi flew inside and froze.

It was the "May 9" casino. The very one where he and Bill fought skeletons in Red Army uniforms. Only now everything looked even more rusty, even older. Machines stood the same, with USSR flags and portraits instead of bath bombs. "GLORY TO THE CPSU" posters still hung above them.

And skeletons. Many skeletons. They stood in even rows, like on parade, in their officer caps, with cigars in their teeth. But now they held not three-line rifles, but huge miniguns — six barrels each, with cartridge belts slung over their shoulders.

— Holy shit, — Pozzi exhaled.

Skeletons turned at the sound. Their skulls clicked in unison, empty eye sockets fixed on Pozzi. Mouths opened wide — apparently for a scream or command.

— R-r-r! — the main skeleton with general insignia growled.

And at that moment the door behind Pozzi exploded.

Venom flew into the hall, sweeping everything in his path. Black mass, tentacles, huge mouth with a palisade of teeth. He froze for a second, assessing the situation.

Skeletons switched instantly. Miniguns hummed, barrels spun, and thousands of bullets fell on Venom.

— Tra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta! — the roar was incredible.

Bullets pierced the black mass through, tore out pieces, but they immediately tightened back. Venom didn't even flinch. He stood under heavy fire and smiled.

— Not painful, — he said. — Cold.

Skeletons fired another burst. Then another. Cartridge belts ran out, barrels glowed red-hot.

Venom yawned. Literally. Opened his mouth and yawned, demonstrating rows of teeth.

— Done? — he asked. — Now me.

He rushed forward with incredible speed. Grabbed the first skeleton by the skull, tore it off and shoved it in his mouth. It crunched.

— Tasty bone, — he commented.

Skeletons tried to run, but no luck. Venom played with them like a cat with mice. He grabbed one by the leg and began using it as a toothpick — poked at his teeth with ribs, then spat it out.

— Wrong stiffness, — he said.

He took another skeleton in both hands and began gnawing it like a beaver gnaws a tree. The skull crunched, bones flew in all directions, and Venom methodically ground it with his jaws.

— Goes well, — he purred contentedly. — Crunchy.

The third skeleton tried to escape, but Venom caught him with a tentacle, pulled him closer and just swallowed him whole, along with the minigun.

— Metal is good for digestion, — he explained.

In five minutes only a pile of bones and a couple of smoking miniguns remained from the entire skeleton army. Venom licked his lips contentedly and turned to where Pozzi had just stood.

But Pozzi was no longer there.

While Venom was entertaining himself with skeletons, Pozzi tiptoed to the exit on the other side of the hall, slipped out the door and dashed down the stairs. He flew without seeing the road, and suddenly ran out onto a landing pad.

A helicopter stood there. Real, military, with the engine running. The dispatcher dashed nearby — the very same one, the first one who saved him back in Las Vegas.

— You?! — the dispatcher screamed, seeing Pozzi. — Where did you come from?

— Later! — Pozzi jumped into the helicopter. — Take off! QUICK!

— But there's...

— TAKE OFF!

The dispatcher yanked the control stick. The helicopter lifted off the pad just as the door from the "May 9" casino flew out along with a piece of wall.

Venom jumped out onto the pad, saw the departing helicopter and roared so that the windows shook.

— POZZI! I'LL GET YOU! EVEN IF I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE FLOORS!

A black tentacle lunged upward, trying to grab the helicopter, but didn't reach.

— Got away, — the dispatcher exhaled, pale as chalk. — Who was that?

— Venom, — Pozzi answered, looking down where the black figure was getting smaller. — Glitch Venom. And now he'll hunt me.

— Why?

— Because I'm the main bug in his system.

The helicopter gained altitude and flew away into the gray sky, and below, on the 23rd floor, Venom long continued to destroy everything around, venting his anger on the skeleton remains.
