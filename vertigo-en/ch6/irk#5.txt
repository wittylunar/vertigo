ch6-irk#5: Jackpot and Ash

Pozzi sat in the empty casino, in front of a machine that flashed its last lights. He threw another token, pulled the lever, and suddenly...

DING-DING-DING-DING!

The machine exploded with fireworks. Light bulbs flashed, bells rang, tokens poured out of the slot — by thousands, by tens of thousands. An inscription lit up on the screen:

JACKPOT!
YOU WON DUBAI'S FORTUNE ×3!

— WHAT?! — Pozzi screamed, jumping up. — I WON?!

Tokens poured and poured, covering the floor, filling his legs to the knees. Pozzi laughed, grabbed them by handfuls, threw them in the air. He was rich. Richer than all the sheikhs put together.

— YES! — he screamed. — NOW I'LL BUY ALL THE CASINOS IN THE WORLD!

And at that moment the lights went out.

All lamps, all lights, all machines — turned off at once. Complete darkness came, only an emergency light flickered somewhere in the distance. Pozzi froze with tokens in his hands.

— Hey! — he shouted. — What's the matter? Bring back the lights!

Silence. Then tokens in his hands began to crumble into dust. Right before his eyes. Gold, silver, plastic — everything turned into gray ash and leaked through his fingers.

— NOOOO! — Pozzi screamed, but it was too late. The mountain of tokens on the floor also thinned, disappeared, leaving only dust after it.

— ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! — he shouted into the darkness.

No one answered. Then Pozzi got really angry. His eyes glowed red — prime mode turned on full. Lasers shot in all directions.

VZH-ZH-ZH!

He spun in place, spraying fire at walls, ceiling, machines, chairs, tables. Everything melted, exploded, collapsed. Lasers cut metal like butter, burned through concrete, incinerated plastic.

— TAKE THIS! — he screamed. — FOR MY JACKPOT! FOR MY FORTUNE! FOR EVERYTHING!

He couldn't stop. Rage boiled in him, and lasers fired without pause. One minute, two, five — until the casino turned into ruins.

When Pozzi finally ran out of breath and lowered his hands, there was emptiness around. Only one wall still stood, but it was cracked. Pozzi looked at it — the wall breathed one last time and crumbled to dust.

— That's it, — he whispered. — No casino, no money, nothing.

He stood in the middle of the desert. Night, stars, sand. And no traces of what had just been an establishment here.

Pozzi took out the notebook. Hands shook. He opened the page and saw that number 1621 still burned. Someone had written next to it:

+0 (casino — not alive, doesn't count)
+0 (jackpot — dreamed)

— Dreamed, — Pozzi smiled bitterly. — Of course, dreamed. Everything's a dream to me.

He put away the notebook, adjusted his plaid shirt and walked into the darkness, wherever his eyes looked.

Lights of a new city loomed somewhere in the distance. Or a new casino. Or another trap.

— Okay, — Pozzi sighed. — Let's go see. Maybe I'll get lucky?
