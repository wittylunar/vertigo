ch9-dm#6: New Author

White room began to disappear. Walls, floor — Pozzi hung in emptiness.

— What's happening?

— System rebooting. You broke the test.

— I didn't break it!

— You found the third option. Characters: a). Humans: b). You: c). Paradox.

Luna appeared. In a black suit, like Corporat.

— Congratulations. You passed the test.

— What test?!

— For author. Only one who can be both character and human can control Vertigo.

— I'm an author now?

— Co-author. I'm the second.

She held out a notebook. Glowing, with golden pages.

— Main notebook of Vertigo. What you write becomes reality.

Pozzi took it. Opened.

— What should I write?

— Whatever you want. Continuation? End? New chapter?

He remembered everything: furries, skeletons, Miami, Arctic, Library, reflections.

He wrote:

"Pozzi continued his journey. 1599 levels ahead. But now he knew — every level is a choice. And he would choose himself."

Page glowed, words disappeared.

— Recorded. Let's go. 500th, 600th, 700th await.

— How many total?

— 2000. But who knows what's after?

Pozzi smiled.

— We'll find out. Together.

They walked through emptiness, turning into a staircase. In the notebook:

1 / 2000

Not kill count. Level count.

Journey continued.

(To be continued...)
