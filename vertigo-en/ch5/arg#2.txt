ch5-arg#2: Penguin Attack

Pozzi fell into the red abyss and suddenly fell back into the snow. The same Arctic, the same penguins at computers, the same igloo in the center. Everything in a circle.

— God damn it! — he screamed, jumping up and brushing himself off. — Again?!

He looked around. Penguins sat just the same, staring at monitors, but now their eyes glowed red. They were hypnotized, like zombies. The same lines flashed on the screens:

uwogylu
uwogylu
uwogylu

— Looks like this kid controls them, — Pozzi realized and dashed to the igloo.

He flew inside, ready to shoot. uwogylu sat in the same place, in front of red holograms. A drawing of Pozzi hung on one of them — exact copy, with plaid shirt, with notebook, with surprised face. And black squares were drawn around the eyes, and an inscription:

WASTED
WASTED
WASTED

— Is this me? — Pozzi didn't understand. — Why wasted? I'm alive!

— For now, — uwogylu grinned, not turning around.

Pozzi whipped out an AK-47 — the very one left by skeletons in the casino. There was only one cartridge in the magazine, but there was no choice. He raised the machine gun and pulled the trigger.

BANG!

The bullet flew straight at uwogylu's head. But a red translucent shield appeared a centimeter from his temple. The bullet hit, flattened and fell to the floor. An inscription flashed for a second above uwogylu's head:

SHIELD: 100%

— What? — Pozzi gasped.

uwogylu slowly turned. His red eyes gleamed with mockery.

— You have one cartridge, and I have one hundred percent protection, — he said. — Uneven fight, right?

He quickly typed something on the keyboard. Fingers flashed so fast they couldn't be seen.

A hum came from outside. Penguins came to life. All at once. They got up from their computers, synchronously turned their heads toward the igloo and walked. Thousands of penguins, with red eyes, clenching their beaks, advanced on the dwelling.

The door swung open. Penguins poured inside, grabbed Pozzi by the arms, by the legs, began tying him with some wires.

— Let go, feathered! — Pozzi screamed, trying to break free.

But immortality pills and molecule multiplier still worked. There was immense strength. Pozzi jerked, wires burst, penguins flew in different directions.

— Come on! — he screamed, whipping out the empty machine gun and starting to beat with the butt left and right.

Penguins fell, but got up again. There were too many of them. Pozzi fought his way to the exit, delivering kicks and blows. One penguin grabbed his leg — Pozzi threw him against the wall. Another clung to the notebook — Pozzi hit him with the butt.

— I'm a furry-killer! — he screamed. — And you're not even furries, you're penguins! But I don't care!

A firefight began. Pozzi fired from an empty machine gun (no cartridges, but penguins didn't know that and shied away from clicks), beat with the butt, kicked, strangled, bit. A real mess was happening in the cramped igloo.

uwogylu watched with a smile, not interfering. Only his fingers continued to run across the keyboard, writing something.

— Interesting specimen, — he muttered. — Very interesting.

Pozzi finally fought his way to the exit, tumbled outside and dashed into the snowy desert. Penguins poured out after him, but ran slowly — flippers don't walk very well on snow.

— Fell behind! — Pozzi exhaled, stopping at a safe distance.

He took out the notebook. Hands shook. Opened the page, added:

+15 penguins (in hand-to-hand) = 1600

— Beautiful number, — he grinned and put away the notebook.

In the distance, at the igloo, penguins still crowded, and above them in the sky hung a red hologram with uwogylu's face, who looked straight at Pozzi and smiled.
