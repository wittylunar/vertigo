## Story Summary

**Pozzi** is a relentless furry-killer who keeps a notebook counting his kills. After winning a mysterious "DANGER" jackpot at a Las Vegas casino, he finds himself trapped in a 355-floor building filled with horrors. Along his descent, he encounters:

- Mutated furries of various classes
- Resurrecting enemies (Tony Stark, MORGENSTERN)
- Mysterious dispatchers and helicopters
- Surreal physics and dream logic
- Soviet-themed underground casinos
- Time loops and parallel realities

The story blends dark comedy, action, and absurdist fiction with video game logic (cheat codes, respawn mechanics, kill counters).
