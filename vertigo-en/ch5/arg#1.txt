ch5-arg#1: Arctic Ambush

Pozzi flew out of the hole punched in space and tumbled across the snow. Cold burned his face, lungs contracted from the frosty air. He got up, brushing himself off, and looked around.

White desert. Ice hummocks. Igloo domes in the distance, with antennas and satellite dishes sticking out of them. And as far as the eye could see, penguins sat. Many penguins. They sat at small tables with laptops on them. Console lines, code lines, Linux logos flashed on the screens.

— Is this the Arctic? — Pozzi mumbled, shivering. Plaid shirt was clearly not suitable for such a climate.

Penguins didn't pay attention to him. They diligently typed on keyboards, occasionally adjusting headphones. Electronic music mixed with incomprehensible words came from the speakers.

— ...ya uwogylu... ya 93... dithtal... phathom legend free... — repeated to the beat.

Pozzi walked among the penguins, trying not to step on anyone's tail. They glanced at him but remained silent. A large igloo glowing with reddish light towered in the center of the settlement.

— Probably there, — Pozzi decided and pushed the door.

It was warm inside. Candles burned, it smelled of burnt coffee and solder. Servers hummed in the corners, lights blinked. A guy sat at a table, staring at holographic screens. About fourteen years old, in a gray hoodie with the hood pulled over his eyes. Red semi-transparent windows with code hung before him. Kali Linux logo burned brightly on one of them.

The guy didn't even turn when Pozzi entered. Just his fingers ran faster across the keyboard.

— Who are you? — Pozzi asked, sensing trouble.

The guy slowly turned. Red eyes gleamed from under the hood — exactly like wittylunar's, only different color. He smirked and said:

— My name is uwogylu. I've been waiting for you, Pozzi.

— How do you know my name?

— I know everything. You're a bug traveling through layers of reality. Your notebook stores a kill count, but actually it's just memory garbage in the system. And I'm the one who fixes these bugs.

uwogylu's fingers ran across the keyboard again. Holograms flashed with new windows. An image of Pozzi appeared on one of them — live, with numbers flickering around.

— What are you doing? — Pozzi became alert.

— Hacking you, — uwogylu answered calmly. — Now I'll enter your code and see what errors you're made of.

Pozzi felt a strange tingling. His hands began to go numb, stripes swam before his eyes. He tried to step, but his legs didn't obey.

— Don't... — he croaked.

— Too late, — uwogylu smiled and pressed Enter.

Everything around spun. Pozzi fell into a red abyss, and it sounded in his ears:

ya uwogylu... ya 93... dithtal... phathom legend free...
