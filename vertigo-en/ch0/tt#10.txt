ch0-tt#10: Casino on 188th

Pozzi ran down the staircase, jumping over steps. 200... 199... 195... 190... Speed was insane—pills worked at full power. He almost no longer felt tired, only excitement and anticipation.

188th floor.

Pozzi flew out onto the landing and froze. Because right in front of him, where a regular door with a number should have been, shone a NEON SIGN.

CASINO ROYALE
BLACKJACK • ROULETTE • JACKPOT

— What? — Pozzi exhaled. — A casino? Here? On the 188th floor?

He rubbed his eyes. The sign shimmered with lights, blinked, invited inside. Music, chip clinking, laughter came from behind the door.

— Did I finally make it? — Pozzi stepped forward, reached his hand toward the door...

And at that moment the sign sparked.

First it just crackled, then flashed bright blue, and the huge neon construction crashed down onto the floor right in front of Pozzi.

BOOM!

Sparks flew in all directions, glass shards scattered. Pozzi jumped back, covering his face. And when he opened his eyes, he saw that behind the fallen sign was no casino. There was a dark room bathed in green light.

Radiation.

And ZOMBIES.

He emerged from the darkness. Huge, glowing, with intestines hanging out and empty eyes. In his hands—a shotgun. Green slime dripped from his mouth.

— Br-r-r, — the zombie said. Or rather, just exhaled, but Pozzi understood.

— Oh you! — Pozzi shouted and reached into his pocket.

There, where he'd stuffed it upstairs, lay those very 10 MORGENSTERN guns. The ones the rapper didn't manage to pull from his pants. Pozzi pulled out two at once, racked the slides and opened fire.

RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!

Bullets embedded in the zombie, tore out chunks of flesh. The zombie staggered, fell... and immediately began to rise. Holes in his body closed, torn pieces grew back. Radiation worked like superglue.

— Damn you! — Pozzi shot again, again, changed guns, then again.

The zombie fell, rose, fell, rose. Did it hurt? No. Nothing bothered him at all. Radiation did its job.

— So, stop, — Pozzi stopped, breathing heavily. — This is endless. Need to think.

And then he remembered.

Cabbage girls. One of them, apparently Eva, had a calculator in her hands. When Pozzi threw them out the window, the calculator fell and rolled into his pocket. He didn't even notice.

Pozzi pulled out the calculator. Regular, cheap, solar-powered. Numbers glowed on the screen.

The zombie had fully recovered and moved toward Pozzi, reaching out his hands.

— Let's see, — Pozzi poked the buttons. — 1448 zombies... no, one zombie... need to divide...

He typed on the calculator:

1 ÷ 0

The calculator beeped. The screen flashed. And it displayed:

ERROR

— Error? — Pozzi didn't understand. — So what does this...

The zombie froze. His body began to vibrate, then distort, as if drawn on an old TV screen. A hum came from inside, then a beep, and suddenly...

VROOOOOOOOM!

The zombie EVAPORATED. Just disappeared, dissolved into the air, leaving only a green radiation cloud behind.

— Damn, — Pozzi exhaled. — Division by zero works!

The radiation cloud still hung in the air. It glowed brighter, compressed into a point and suddenly made a sound:

— Las.....

And fell silent. Batteries died. The cloud dissipated.

— Las? — Pozzi repeated. — Las Vegas? Is that what you meant to say?

But the radiation wanted nothing anymore. It simply disappeared, leaving only the smell of ozone and burnt plastic behind.

Pozzi took out his notebook. 1524. Added:

+1 = 1525

— Zombie with radiation, — he mumbled. — Was alive too. Well, almost.

He put away the notebook, stuffed the calculator in his pocket (might come in handy again) and looked at the door behind which the casino used to be. Now there was just an empty room with broken machines and corpses of real visitors.

— Deceived, — Pozzi sighed. — Deceived again.

And he ran further.

Now he didn't even look at the floors. 180... 170... 160... 150... Everything blurred into a gray strip. Sometimes some figures, doors, inscriptions flashed by, but Pozzi didn't stop. Only down. Only to the first floor.

100... 90... 80... 70... 60...

On 50 he almost tripped over someone's corpse but jumped over.

40... 30... 20... 10... 5... 4... 3... 2...

Second floor. Pozzi flew out onto the landing, ran down the corridor, found the staircase down and sprinted.

First floor.

Door. Sign "EXIT." Pozzi pushed it and went outside.

What he saw looked like a battlefield. Corpses everywhere. Furries, people, some incomprehensible creatures. All in blood, in smoke, in ruins. But amid this hell stood IT.

A HELICOPTER.

Real, military, with an open door and running engine. Blades spun, lights glowed inside, and a dispatcher in headphones shouted something into the radio.

Pozzi sprinted to the helicopter. The dispatcher saw him, bulged his eyes and shouted:

— It's him! That one! From the asylum! Alive! Quick, into the helicopter!

Pozzi flew inside. The dispatcher slammed the door, shouted to the pilot:

— TAKE OFF! FAST!

The helicopter jerked and began to rise. Below remained corpses, ruins, smoke. All this diminished, went downward.

— Where are we flying? — Pozzi asked, catching his breath.

The dispatcher turned around. Undisguised horror was written on his face.

— To Las Vegas, — he answered. — They're waiting for us there. There's always danger. But that's what you want?

Pozzi smiled. For the first time in a long time.

— I do, — he said. — Very much.

The helicopter gained altitude and headed toward lights that were already visible on the horizon. Real lights of a real city.

Pozzi took out his notebook. Looked at the last number: 1525. Thought and added at the bottom:

AND THERE WILL BE MANY MORE

— Because in Vegas, — he explained to the dispatcher, — there's always someone to hunt.

The dispatcher nervously swallowed and turned to the window.

And the helicopter flew into the night, toward danger, toward the jackpot, toward a new story.
