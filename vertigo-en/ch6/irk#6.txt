ch6-irk#6: Optimus without BIOS

Pozzi trudged across the desert, cursing everything. He had just lost Dubai's fortune, destroyed the casino to pieces and again remained with empty pockets and a notebook with a dismal number 1621 in it.

— And where's justice here? — he mumbled, kicking sand. — I won fairly! And they turned off the lights! Cheats!

A light loomed in the distance. Bright, reddish, pulsating. Pozzi became alert, but his legs carried him there themselves — maybe there's another casino there? Or at least a roadside diner?

The light approached, and soon Pozzi made out the source. It was him. Red optimus prime. The very one from the squad that chased him in the Arctic. Stood in the middle of the desert, gleaming with armor, and his optical sensors glowed sinister crimson.

— God damn it, — Pozzi exhaled, turning to run.

But the optimus had already noticed him. His blasters stirred, aimed straight at Pozzi's chest. A mechanical voice boomed:

— Target detected. Executing liquidation protocol.

Laser beams shot from the barrels. Pozzi ducked, but the beams didn't even reach — they went out halfway, not getting within a meter of him. Optimus jerked, made a strange sound, like a computer glitch, and his eyes flickered.

— Error... insufficient energy... BIOS battery discharged... — he grated. — Perform... recharge...

— What? — Pozzi didn't understand, peeking out from behind his elbow.

Optimus swayed, took a step, then another, and suddenly fell to his knees. A spark flew out of his chest, eyes went out, and he froze, turning into a pile of red metal.

— Turned off? — Pozzi was surprised. — Forgot to charge the battery? What a dope!

He carefully approached the motionless robot, knocked on the armor. No reaction. Optimus was dead (well, or in a deep sleep without BIOS).

Pozzi went around him and saw what stood nearby. A car. A sports car, red, with an open door and a key in the ignition. Apparently optimus drove here on it, or maybe it was his alternative form — but now it was just a car.

— Oh, — Pozzi rejoiced. — Transport!

He jumped inside, turned the key. The engine roared like a thousand demons. Pozzi pressed the gas, and the car took off, raising sand.

— YEE-HAW! — he screamed, pressing the pedal to the floor.

The speedometer crawled up: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 km/h! Wind blew dust off the road, headlights cut an endless highway out of the darkness, going beyond the horizon.

— Now that's speed! — Pozzi shouted. — Now nobody will catch me!

He drove along the desert highway, leaving behind the disconnected optimus, casino ruins, and all his problems. A map was found in the glove compartment, which said: "BAGHDAD — 500 km". Next to it — a bottle of water and several packs of chips.

— Can live, — Pozzi decided, biting into the package.

He wrote in the notebook:

+0 (optimus prime — not killed, just turned off)
+1 (hijacked car — doesn't count, but will come in handy)

— Let's see what's there, in Baghdad, — he mumbled, peering into the darkness. — They say there's an underground casino. And, seems, some skibidi toilets fight for oil. But I don't care. Main thing is jackpot.

The car raced across the night desert, and Pozzi dreamed of a new win. Unknown lay ahead, but that never stopped him.
