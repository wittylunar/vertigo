A week passed.

Pozzi lived.

Work. Home. Friends. Beach.

— How are you? — they asked.

— Good, — he answered.

— Really?

— Yes.

— You're happy?

— Yes.

— After everything?

— Yes.

— How?

— Simply.

— What?

— The path.

Friends smiled.

— Glad, — they said.

— Me too, — Pozzi said.

And it was the truth.
