ch16-sh#2: Forgiveness

— What to do? — Pozzi asked.

— Forgive, — Luna said.

— Who?

— Everyone.

— Even Venom?

— Yes.

— He tried to kill me!

— And you him.

— He was a glitch!

— Was. Now shadow.

— Why forgive?

— To let go.

— Who?

— Yourself.

— I'm not holding.

— You are. Guilt.

— Not holding!

— Holding. In notebook.

— Notebook has numbers!

— No. Souls.

Pozzi was silent.

— Forgive, — Venom said.

— What?

— Forgive. I'm not evil. Was a program.

— And you? — Pozzi to skeletons.

— Us too, — they said. — System made us.

— And you? — to Corporat.

— I'm the first, — he said. — Who didn't pass.

— Didn't pass what?

— Test. Like you.

— And now what?

— Forgive us. And yourself.

Pozzi closed his eyes.

— I forgive, — he said.

Light.
