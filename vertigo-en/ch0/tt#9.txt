ch0-tt#9: Elevator

Pozzi flew out onto the 476th floor and almost hit a wall. Because right in front of him, shining with metal doors, stood IT.

AN ELEVATOR.

Real, working, with buttons, with mirrors, with a sign "TO 1ST FLOOR — HEROES ONLY."

— Holy mother, — Pozzi exhaled. — Finally?

He ran up, pressed the call button. Doors opened instantly, as if waiting just for him. Pleasant music played inside, smelled of air freshener, and someone's forgotten newspaper lay on the floor with the headline "VEGAS ACCEPTS BETS."

— This is a sign, — Pozzi whispered and flew into the elevator.

He pressed the button with number "1." Doors closed. The elevator jerked and went down.

— Finally, — Pozzi relaxed, leaning against the wall. — Now I'll descend, get in the helicopter and fly to the casino. Blackjack, Monroe, lights...

He dreamily closed his eyes. The elevator gained speed. 470... 460... 450... Everything went great.

And then something thundered somewhere above.

Pozzi opened his eyes. The elevator jerked, froze for a second, and suddenly...

VROOOOOOM!

The cables snapped.

The cabin fell and flew downward at insane speed.

— A-A-A-A-A! — Pozzi screamed, clutching the handrails. — WHAT THE HELL?!

Numbers on the display flashed like crazy: 440... 420... 400... 380... The elevator shook, sparks flew from the walls, the mirror shattered to pieces, light bulbs flickered and went out.

380... 360... 340...

— Brake, you idiot! — Pozzi shouted, but the elevator didn't listen.

320... 300... 280...

The cabin was thrown from side to side. Pozzi flew to one wall, then to another, stars flashed before his eyes.

260... 240... 220...

— Gotta jump! — he realized. — Otherwise I'll be smashed flat!

He jumped to the doors, grabbed the panels and pried them apart with wild effort. Wind flew through the opening, sparks, some debris. Floors flashed behind the doors—gray walls, grates, lights.

200th floor!

Pozzi squeezed his eyes shut and jumped.

He flew out of the elevator in a tumble, rolled across the concrete floor, hit the wall and froze. Behind him, somewhere far below, an explosion thundered—the elevator reached the first floor without him.

— Phew, — Pozzi exhaled, getting up. — Alive.

He moved his arms, legs—everything worked. Pills apparently not only satisfied hunger but also strengthened bones.

Pozzi looked around. He was on the 200th floor. Regular corridor, dim light, a sign on the wall. And at the end of the corridor—a door with an inscription: "EMERGENCY EXIT TO STAIRCASE."

— Well there, — he sighed. — On foot again. 199 more floors.

He took out his notebook. Number 1524 was still in it. Pozzi pondered: should he count the elevator? Elevator's not alive. Although it almost killed Pozzi. But the notebook is for kills, not rescues.

— Fine, — he decided. — We don't count the elevator.

He put away the notebook and walked toward the door. But suddenly stopped.

A hissing sound came from his pocket. The radio! The very one from the 500th floor suddenly came to life and spoke:

— Poz... zi... Where are you? Over... Helicopter on the first... waiting... just... faster... they're close...

— Who's close? — Pozzi shouted into the radio. — Who?!

But the radio fell silent again. Forever. Now definitely forever.

Pozzi looked at it, shrugged, and threw it into a dark corner.

— They'll figure it out themselves, — he grumbled and pushed the door to the staircase.

Ahead were 199 floors. And below—a helicopter. And a casino. And Monroe.

Or not?
