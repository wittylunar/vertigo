ch4-wi#1: Galaxy ORH-6218

The black hole cracked at the seams. Literally. Its perfect blackness went white with stripes, like an old TV that decided to die. Then it shuddered, hiccuped and... deleted itself. Just disappeared, leaving only a message on a blue screen: "ERROR: MEMORY FULL. ALL DATA DUMPED."

And spilled out everything it had.

Pozzi was flying through space at 67 light years per hour. His ears were ringing (though there's nothing to ring in a vacuum), stars, galaxies and some debris flashed before his eyes. Nearby, for a second, frozen Bill Phil Patronaphil flashed by — mouth open, eyes bulging, covered in frost. He waved his hand (or maybe it was just a stiff limb twitching) and disappeared into the black void.

— Bill! — Pozzi shouted, but his voice didn't carry. Only air bubbles flew out of his mouth and froze.

Pozzi flew past galaxies like a bullet. The Milky Way remained behind, Andromeda flashed and disappeared. Finally, a spiral loomed ahead with an inscription (yes, there were inscriptions in space, like in Google Maps) — GALAXY ORH-6218.

— Brake! — Pozzi screamed, but there were no brakes.

He crashed right into a door. Huge, wooden, with wrought iron hinges, hanging in the middle of space. The door swung open, and Pozzi flew inside.

Gravity instantly became earthly. Pozzi tumbled down concrete steps and stopped on the landing. His notebook lay nearby — it had fallen out of his pocket during the flight.

— Alive, — Pozzi croaked, getting up. — Bill... Bill!

He looked around. Bill was nowhere to be seen. Only in the distance, in open space (the door remained open), a small frozen figure was visible, carried away into the abyss.

— Damn, — Pozzi sighed. — Good guy he was. Great cartridges he had.

He closed the door (it slammed with a dull thud), picked up the notebook and looked at the numbers. 1538 was still on the page. Next to it someone had written in pencil: "Bill — doesn't count, froze himself".

— Well, at least so, — Pozzi put away the notebook and began to descend.

The staircase was ordinary, concrete, with dim light bulbs. Pozzi went down one flight and entered a hall.

It was a casino. But not like before. Everything was rusty, covered with green oxide, as if it had lain at the bottom of the sea for a thousand years. The walls were wooden, with carved window frames, kerosene lamps hung from the ceiling. A sign hung above the entrance:

"9XWIN" CASINO
ANCIENT RUS STYLE

— Holy cow, — Pozzi whistled. — Ancient Rus? And where are the bears with balalaikas?

Instead of bears stood slot machines. Also rusty, with wooden cases decorated with khokhloma. Instead of cherries and diamonds on the reels were plates (apparently ancient Russian money) and portraits of some young man in a hoodie.

Pozzi looked closer. The inscription read: "EGOR KRID — BOMBOCHKA".

— Is this him instead of bath bombs? — Pozzi chuckled. — Well, designers have humor.

He approached the nearest machine, pulled the lever. The reels spun with a creak and stopped: plate, plate, Egor Krid. The machine poured out a handful of rusty tokens with a double-headed eagle.

— Hmm, — Pozzi turned the token over. — Maybe I'll get lucky?

He started playing. Over and over the machine gave out tokens. Pozzi excitedly pulled the lever, not noticing time. Finally, after another spin, the machine flashed, hoarse music played:

"Arise, great country... arise for a deadly fight..." — the same one as in the "May 9" casino, but even older and with interference.

A huge rusty chest fell out of the machine. All in green oxide, with a lock engraved with: "JACKPOT".

— Wow, — Pozzi ran up to the chest, knocked off the lock with a gun butt and opened the lid.

Inside lay a box. A regular cardboard one, with "GTA 67" written on it. Some gangster with the number 67 on his neck was drawn on the cover.

— GTA? — Pozzi was surprised. — Sixty-seven? Never heard of it.

He took the box in his hands. And at that moment the chest came to life.

More precisely, skeletons began to crawl out of it. But not simple ones — in suits. Top hats, tailcoats, white gloves — real gentlemen. In their bony hands — AK-47s, polished to a shine.

— Oh, boss, — said one skeleton with a monocle. — We have guests.

— And he took our game, — added another, adjusting his bow tie.

— Fire, — commanded the third.

The skeletons opened fire.

Pozzi ducked, bullets whistled overhead. He dashed to the stairs, pressing the GTA 67 box to his chest.

— Stop! — the skeletons shouted, stomping with bony feet.

Pozzi flew up the stairs, jumping over steps. Shots thundered behind. A floor number plate flashed on the wall. Pozzi managed to read:

"-..........._......"

— What the fuck? — he gasped, but didn't stop.

He ran up, and the gentleman skeletons didn't lag behind. Somewhere below the hoarse war music still played.
