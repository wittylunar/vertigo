ch3-sp#5: Bill Phil Patronafil

Pozzi trudged down the staircase, kicking rare pebbles and cursing everything. 46th floor remained behind, 45th, 40th... Mood couldn't be worse. Dispatcher turned into a skeleton, house turned out to be a dream, and notebook with numbers appeared then disappeared.

— What crap, — he muttered. — Now staircase, now gym, now staircase again. Where's the promised casino? Where's danger? Where are furries, finally?

On the 23rd floor he heard footsteps. Someone walked toward him, from below upward. Pozzi tensed, took out his MORGENSTERN gun—the very one, the last one that miraculously survived all the troubles.

A silhouette emerged from the darkness. A person. Regular, not a furry, not a mutant. In strange clothes—some vests with pockets, pants with patches, a bunch of pouches on the belt. He walked and smiled.

— Freeze! — Pozzi shouted, aiming the gun. — Who are you?

The stranger stopped, smiled even wider, and spread his arms.

Pozzi pressed the trigger.

Click.

Nothing.

Click. Click. Click.

— Damn it... — Pozzi shook the gun, looked into the magazine. Empty. Completely empty. — No ammo!

The stranger laughed. Not evilly, but kindly, like an old friend at a joke. Then he stuck his hand into one of the countless pockets of his vest and pulled out a handful of bullets. Then into another pocket—another handful. Then into a third—and bullets poured out like from a horn of plenty. They fell onto the floor, clinked, rolled down the steps.

— Damn, — Pozzi exhaled, looking at this wealth.

The stranger stopped laughing, wiped a tear, and said:

— Bill. Bill Phil Patronafil.

— What? — Pozzi didn't understand.

— Bill Phil Patronafil, — the stranger repeated. — Just Bill for short. I walk around here, collect bullets. And you, I see, are a shooter? Your gun is cool, old school. MORGENSTERN, right?

— How do you know? — Pozzi tensed.

— I know everything about bullets, — Bill smiled. — And about guns too. And you, I see, have a problem. No ammo. And I have. A lot.

He patted his countless pockets, and clinking came from there.

— Selling? — Pozzi asked.

— Trading, — Bill answered. — For information. Where are you coming from? What did you see? Where are furries? Where's the casino? I've been wandering here a month, met no one except skeletons.

— A month? — Pozzi was surprised. — And I, seems, already lived 68 lives here. Either wake up again, or sleep, or these staircases...

— Oh, — Bill's eyes lit up. — So you're a layer traveler! Rare specimen. Listen, let's do this: you tell where you saw what, and I'll give you bullets. Deal?

Pozzi thought for a second, then nodded. He knew how to tell stories, and bullets were desperately needed.

— Sit, — Bill pointed at a step. — Let's go in order. From the very beginning.

They sat on the staircase, and Pozzi began to tell. About vertigo, about furries, about the casino with skeletons, about 355 floors, about the dispatcher, about the gym, about the child with the phone. Bill listened attentively, sometimes nodded, sometimes put new bullets under himself to sit more comfortably.

— Interesting, — he said when Pozzi finished. — Very interesting. So you already killed 1538 furries?

— Did, — Pozzi confirmed. — But the notebook appears then disappears. I'm already confused.

— Notebook is an anchor, — Bill said importantly. — As long as you believe in it, it exists. Stop believing—it disappears.

— A philosopher, huh? — Pozzi snorted.

— No, I'm a bullet-man, — Bill smiled. — But a bit of a philosopher. Here, take.

He dumped a pile of bullets in front of Pozzi. Different calibers, brands, colors. Some even glowed.

— Take as much as you can carry. For the story.

Pozzi didn't make himself be begged. Stuffed pockets, shoved inside his shirt, even stuck a couple of magazines in his socks.

— And where are you going further? — he asked, loaded like a Christmas tree.

— Down, — Bill answered. — They say there's an exit on the 1st floor. But I haven't reached it yet. Keep collecting bullets along the way.

— I'm also going down, — Pozzi said. — Shall we go together?

— Let's go, — Bill nodded. — More fun together.

And they went down the staircase. Pozzi—loaded with bullets, Bill—pockets clinking. And behind them, on the 23rd floor, a handful of scattered bullets remained lying that they forgot to pick up.

— Let others have them, — Bill waved his hand.
