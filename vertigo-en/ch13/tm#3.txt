ch13-tm#3: Portals

Level 1500 — hall of portals. Dozens of vortexes in the air.

— Where do they lead? — Pozzi asked.

— Everywhere.

— Is there one to 1800th?

— There is. But which one?

— How to know?

— Enter and see.

— What if I'm wrong?

— You'll return. But lose time.

Pozzi approached the first portal. Desert behind it.

— Not that.

Second: ocean.

— Not that.

Third: fire.

— Not that either.

— Maybe ask? — Luna suggested.

— Who?

— The portals.

— They talk?

— Yes. If you listen.

Pozzi closed his eyes. Listened.

Whisper from portals. One called quietly, persistently.

— This one.

He pointed to a blue vortex.

— Sure?

— Yes.

— Then go.

— And you?

— I'm with you.

They held hands.

Stepped into the portal.
