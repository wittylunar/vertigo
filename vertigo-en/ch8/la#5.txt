ch8-la#5: Boss Corporat

The platform was the size of a football field. A throne in the center. A man in a black suit sat on it, with a golden mask. A sword glowed blue nearby.

— Pozzi. You've come far. But your path ends here.

— I need to go further. To the 200th.

— 200th? You can't even beat me.

He took the sword. The blade hummed.

— You have a choice. Join me. Become a guard of Vertigo. You'll get power, authority, immortality.

— Second option?

— Death.

— You know, I'm tired of these choices. Let's just fight.

Corporat swung the sword — a blue ray cut through the air. Pozzi jumped, his shirt caught fire.

His eyes glowed red. He shot — the ray disappeared, absorbed by a shield.

— Weak.

Corporat rushed to attack. The sword whistled, the platform cracked.

— You don't understand. Vertigo is a test. To find the worthy.

— And you think it's me?

— I hope not. You're too chaotic.

Corporat swung for the final blow. Pozzi pulled out the chip, inserted it into his machine gun. The gun transformed — a plasma rifle.

— Oh no.

He pulled the trigger.
